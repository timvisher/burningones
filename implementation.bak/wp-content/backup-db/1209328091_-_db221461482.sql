The improvements in 2.5 are numerous, and almost entirely a result of your feedback: multi-file uploading, one-click plugin upgrades, built-in galleries, customizable dashboard, salted passwords and cookie encryption, media library, a WYSIWYG that doesn&#8217;t mess with your code, concurrent post editing protection, full-screen writing, and search that covers posts <em>and</em> pages.</p>\n<p>For a short overview of the features with screenshots, it&#8217;d be best to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/\">visit our sneak peek announcement for RC1</a>. Or check out <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/\">a 4-minute screencast of the new interface in action</a>. If you just want to jump straight to the good stuff <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">here&#8217;s where you can find 2.5 upgrade and download information</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see everything I would grab a cup of coffee or a mojito, because this post is epic.</p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<p><strong>Cleaner, faster, less cluttered dashboard</strong> &#8212; we&#8217;ve worked hard to take your feedback about what&#8217;s most important in the dashboard and organize things to allow you to focus on what&#8217;s important &#8212; your blog &#8212; and get out of your way. In collaboration with <a href=\"http://happycog.com/\">Happy Cog</a> and the community  we&#8217;ve taken the first major step forward in the WordPress interface since version 1.5.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashboard Widgets</strong> &#8212; the dashboard home page is now a series of widgets, including ones to show you fun stats about your posting, latest comments, people linking to you, new and popular plugins, and of course WordPress news. You can customize any of the dashboard widgets to show, for example, news from your local paper instead of WP news. Plugins can also hook in, for example the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/\">WordPress.com stats widget</a> adds a handy double-wide stats box.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/stats-widget.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Multi-file upload with progress bar</strong> &#8212; before when you would upload a large file you&#8217;d wait forever, never knowing how far along it was.

Then WordPress 2.5 might be the release for you. It&#8217;s been in the oven for a while, and we&#8217;re finally ready to open the doors a bit to give you a taste.</p>\n<p>For the past few months, we’ve been working with our friends at Happy Cog &#8212; <a href=\"http://zeldman.com/\">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href=\"http://jasonsantamaria.com/\">Jason Santa Maria</a>, and <a href=\"http://bobulate.com/\">Liz Danzico</a> &#8212; to redesign WordPress from the ground-up. The result is a new way of interacting with WordPress that will remain familiar to seasoned users while improving the experience for everyone. This isn’t just a fresh coat of paint &#8212; we’ve re-thought the look of WordPress, as well as how it’s organized so that you can forget about the software and focus on your own creative pursuits.</p>\n<p>Here are a few vignettes of what&#8217;s in store.</p>\n<h3>The Dashboard</h3>\n<p class=\"tutscreen\"><img src=\"http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/dashboard-wide.png\" alt=\"dashboard-wide.png\" /></p>\n<p>The Dashboard’s most important role is to inform quickly and get you to where you’re headed in the admin. In interviewing users, we found that most of you ignore the Dashboard entirely &#8212; its useful information being mostly hidden in an overly complex design. The new Dashboard is focused on the most relevant tasks at hand: a quick summary of what’s published and scheduled for publication, the latest comments and incoming links, blog stats, and WordPress updates and news. You can add your own RSS feeds and edit the way information is presented so that the new Dashboard conforms to the way you use WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<p class=\"tutscreen\"><img src=\"http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/nav-wide.png\" alt=\"nav-wide.png\" /></p>\n<p>The WordPress navigation has confounded even sophisticated users. With the new design, we’ve cut the number of navigation options in half, separating the primary functions (writing, managing posts and pages, editing the blog’s design, and managing comments) from secondary functions. This presents information at a more comfortable pace, revealing only the information that’s necessary. Everything you need is still there &#8212; just better organized. (Especially for people new to WP.)</p>\n<h3>Write</h3>\n<p class=\"tutscreen\"><img src=\"http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/write-wide.png\" alt=\"write-wide.png\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"right\" src=\"http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/write3.png\" alt=\"write2.png\" /></p>\n<p>By far, the most frequently accessed part of WordPress is the Write screen. It gets the job done, but its myriad options can be overwhelming. The new write screen only displays the information that you’ll use most often. It displays the most common fields in a way that makes posting incredibly easy. Additional options are hidden away until you need them. The new Write screen anticipates the natural flow of the way you write, and is smart enough to remember the way you left it so that your preferred writing environment is always quickly available. The new visual editor even has a handy full-screen mode to help block out distractions while composing your newest post. (My personal favorite new feature.)</p>\n<h3>Manage</h3>\n<p class=\"tutscreen\"><img src=\"http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage-wide.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"right\" src=\"http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The Manage screens have been redesigned and unified so that now, managing your pages, posts, media, and comments all use similar, consistent interfaces. We’ve omitted superfluous information and made what’s important faster to find. We believe these changes will make you a faster, more proficient blogger.</p>\n<p>You might also notice there are some new colors, the dashboard feels much fresher and lighter. If you&#8217;re jonesing for the old look under your user options you can now select the &#8220;classic&#8221; colors and get those old blues back. (It&#8217;s also pluggable so people can easily add or share their own color schemes.)</p>\n<p>If you make frequent backups and you&#8217;re interested in helping us out with development by testing the new code, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip\">download</a> and install <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip\">Release Candidate 1</a> of WordPress 2.5, and <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers\">join our testers mailing list</a> to report any bugs you find in the code.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also interested in feedback on the new interface and would love to hear your opinions, thoughts, rants, raves, and anything in between.

If you&#8217;re not the largest site using a given piece of software or framework and you&#8217;re having more trouble than someone who is, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>\n<p>With WordPress specifically, there are hundreds of sites I can point to that scale just fine to meaningful traffic levels with no caching, plugins, or anything. If your server is tuned for serving static files instead of dynamic requests, then a plugin to make WP output static files is a fine band-aid, but only if you don&#8217;t have the access or expertise to properly configure things in the first place. (In which case you should consider alternative hosting, help, or a hosted service like WordPress.com.)

The organizers, Charles Stricklin and John Pozadzides, welcomed everyone and we all got a chance to get to know each other before we buckled down for a long weekend of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Saturday and Sunday were jam-packed with terrific speakers. Laptops were everywhere in the audience, along with video cameras, and everything else to help live blog and capture every moment - or at least check in with blog comments and email while waiting for the speaker to get to the point. <img src=\"http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Kidding.</p>\n<p>Every speaker was distinctive and brought something new and exciting to blogging and WordPress. The highlight for most was the announcement by Matt Mullenweg, the first speaker on Saturday, of the release of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/\" title=\"WordPress 2.5\">WordPress 2.5</a> only a few minutes before he walked on the stage. </p>\n<p>John Pozadzides worked with the Frisco City Hall facility and has uploaded the videos of the

href=\"http://dallas.wordcamp.org/\" title=\"WordCamp Dallas at Frisco City Hall near Dallas, Texas\" rel=\"tag\">WordCamp Dallas</a> in Frisco, Texas, began Friday night with a bang of social fun at a local restaurant, with a lot of the participants and speakers talking WordPress and blogging, and getting to know each other while competing with the loud volume of the announcements for diners.</p>\n<p>The beers were huge and the people were wonderful. The organizers, Charles Stricklin and John Pozadzides, welcomed everyone and we all got a chance to get to know each other before we buckled down for a long weekend of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Saturday and Sunday were jam-packed with terrific speakers. Laptops were everywhere in the audience, along with video cameras, and everything else to help live blog and capture every moment - or at least check in with blog comments and email while waiting for the speaker to get to the point. <img src=\"http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Kidding.</p>\n<p>Every speaker was distinctive and brought something new and exciting to blogging and WordPress. The highlight for most was the announcement by Matt Mullenweg, the first speaker on Saturday, of the release of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/\" title=\"WordPress 2.5\">WordPress 2.5</a> only a few minutes before he walked on the stage. </p>\n<p>John Pozadzides worked with the Frisco City Hall facility and has uploaded the videos of the conference.<br />\n<span id=\"more-2450\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.viddler.com/explore/jpozadzides/videos/71/\" title=\"Matt Mullenweg\'s State of WordPress\">Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s

Using Yougler which is pronounced <strong>(Yoo-Guh-Ler)</strong> users can create profiles that bloggers can link to for spam free contact information. One of the long standing problems that bloggers have faced is the way in which end user&#8217;s can communicate with the blog author. Usually, this would consist of typing out your email address as so ( blabla at blabla.com). Replacing @ with at was a very inexpensive way of defeating the spam bots which would scrape the content of websites looking for printed email addresses but this method creates a few caveats.

The <a title=\"http://www.yougler.com/_create-white-pages.php\" href=\"http://www.yougler.com/_create-white-pages.php\" target=\"_blank\">White Pages Profile</a> is for those who want a presence on the Internet, more or less to be found within search results.

This is the profile you would want to use if you want an easy way for your readers to contact you which I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this article, we&#8217;ll focus on the blogger profile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/04/bloggingprofile.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3434\" title=\"bloggingprofile\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/04/bloggingprofile.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" height=\"236\" /></a></p>\n<p>After typing in your information, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a CAPTCHA image which is used to prevent automated bots from creating Yougler accounts. I&#8217;m sure those profiles would be rather interesting to see. After the CAPTCHA process is complete, Yougler sends you a confirmation email which you&#8217;ll have to confirm in order to activate your account. Once your account is activated, it&#8217;s time to download and then install the <a title=\"http://www.yougler.com/wordpress-plugins/yougler-blogger-profile-plugin.php\" href=\"http://www.yougler.com/wordpress-plugins/yougler-blogger-profile-plugin.php\" target=\"_blank\">Yougler WordPress Plugin.</a></p>\n<h2>The WordPress Plugin</h2>\n<p>The plugin provides an easy way to provide a contact link which is attached to the top of a post and then at the bottom of the post. The link forwards people to your Yougler Profile Page where readers can get a gist as to who you are via your profile and then, send mail-forwarded mail. Providing a means of communication in this way is supposed to keep communication between the blog author and his or her readers easy while at the same time, blocking unwanted spam.</p>\n<p>Installing the plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/yougler-blogger-profile-page.zip\">Download the Yougler plugin</a> to your desktop. Upload the entire Yougler plugin folder to your WordPress plugins directory under wp-content/plugins/.</li>\n<li>Activate your plugin under the WordPress Plugins tab.</li>\n<li>Click options, click Yougler, set &#8220;add signature and Yougler link at end of post to yes.&#8221; Enter whatever signature you would like to add to the end of your posts in the box provided or you may leave this blank. Click update and you are done.</li>\n<li>The Yougler Plugin will now create a link to your Yougler Profile page at the end of all your posts. The link name will be your &#8220;Display name publicly as:&#8221; setting under the User&#8217;s tab in WordPress. Yougler will display the author&#8217;s name and url on each post so if a blog has multiple bloggers this should not be an issue.Your Yougler page will provide a form mail page for your readers to contact you. On your Yougler page you can also tell your readers a little about yourself or your blog. You can also add a picture (and maybe some more things in the future).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is a screenshot that showcases a Yougler configured plugin in WordPress.

The link name will be your &#8220;<strong>Publicly displayed as name</strong>&#8221; which is configured under the User&#8217;s tab in WordPress. Your Yougler page contains an avatar, a small bio section and a form for people to contact you. Aside from that, readers can insert their own Yougler Profile URLS in their comments so others can contact them as well without worrying about spam.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/04/youglerinaction1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3437\" title=\"youglerinaction1\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/04/youglerinaction1-300x121.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"121\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yougler is free at the moment and it looks like it will continue to be free.

However, as far as the spam communication goes, I think the same affect could be accomplished by publishing your email address in the form of a picture that when clicked on, opens up your preferred email client. Also worthy of noting is that, if you were to browse someones About Me page on their blog and that page had a contact me button or form on that page, would there then be any reason for you to use this service?</p>\n<p>I think the true strength of this service is for multi author blogs where the about me section is usually limited to the information about the blogging network or the domain and not the actual blogging authors.</p>\n<p>If you happen to use this service, I&#8217;d be very interested in knowing what your experience is like.

Also worthy of noting is that, if you were to browse someones About Me page on their blog and that page had a contact me button or form on that page, would there then be any reason for you to use this service?</p>\n<p>I think the true strength of this service is for multi author blogs where the about me section is usually limited to the information about the blogging network or the domain and not the actual blogging authors.</p>\n<p>If you happen to use this service, I&#8217;d be very interested in knowing what your experience is like. I&#8217;d also like to know how you have implemented this service into your blog/blogs.</p>\";}i:36;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:70:\"Lorelle on WP: WordPress.com Banned Again: Why Aren’t You Concerned?\";s:4:\"guid\";s:36:\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=2496\";s:4:\"link\";s:90:\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/04/17/wordpresscom-banned-again-why-arent-you-concerned/\";s:11:\"description\";s:17571:\"<div class=\"snap_preview\"><br /><p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/wordpresscom-banned.gif\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/wordpresscom-banned.gif\" align=\"right\" alt=\"WordPress.com blogs banned\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2497\" /></a>According to <a href=\"http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2008/04/12/brazil-bloggers-united-against-wordpress-ban/\" title=\"Bloggers united against WordPress ban\">Brazil: Bloggers united against WordPress.com ban by Global Voices</a>, WordPress.com blogs are or soon will be banned due to a judge in Brazil ruling against a WordPress.com blogger featuring a YouTube video embedded in the blog of a couple having sex. </p>\n<p>The details of the blogger and content in question is a bit vague, but this is not the <a href=\"http://www.blogherald.com/2007/08/22/wordpress-wednesday-news-happy-birthday-wordpresscom-wordcamps-in-beijing-and-israel-censorship-in-turkey-and-more-wordpress-news/\" title=\"Happy Birthday WordPress.com, WordCamps in Beijing and Israel, Censorship in Turkey, and More WordPress News\">first time</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2007/11/if_you_live_in_china.php\" title=\"BetterKnowanSFBlog\">nor the last</a>, that international courts have made a <a href=\"http://www.blogherald.com/2007/08/29/wordpress-wednesday-news-wordpress-plugin-winners-23-beta-wordcamp-in-beijing-and-israel-wordpresscom-banned-in-turkey-and-more-wordpress-news/\" title=\"WordPress Plugin Winners, 2.3 Beta, WordCamp in Beijing and Israel, WordPress.com Banned in Turkey, and More WordPress News\">sweeping judgment against WordPress.com</a> due to the actions of an individual blogger.

I want my WordPress.com blog to be read by those in Brazil, Turkey, China, and everywhere in the world. Don&#8217;t you? Why should my blog be penalized because of the actions of one? </p>\n<p>People are asking Automattic to take a stand. I&#8217;m asking bloggers around the world to take a stand and let their voices be heard when others can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Let not millions of bloggers be blocked and banned for the sake of a couple of idiots. You don&#8217;t send an entire city&#8217;s population to jail because two people break the law. Maybe the world would be a better place if we did, but that&#8217;s another discussion. <img src=\"http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<h4>Related Articles</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/content-theft-and-wordpress/\" title=\"Content Theft and WordPress\">Content Theft and WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/04/10/what-do-you-do-when-someone-steals-your-content/\" title=\"What Do You Do When Someone Steals Your Content « Lorelle on WordPress\">What Do You Do When Someone Steals Your Content</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2007/09/13/attack-of-the-mean-commenter-blocking-commenters-and-comments-on-your-wordpress-blog/\" title=\"Blocking Commenters and Comments on ...\">Attack of the Mean Commenter: Blocking Commenters and Comments on Your WordPress Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/09/08/one-year-anniversary-review-bloggers-rights-and-the-risks-of-blogging/\" title=\"Blogger’s Rights and the Risks of Blogging\">One Year Anniversary Review: Blogger’s Rights and the Risks of Blogging</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/05/19/fortune-cookie-blogging/\" title=\"Fortune Cookie Blogging\">Fortune Cookie Blogging</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/04/24/the-committee-to-protect-bloggers-risking-your-life-for-your-words/\" title=\"The Committee to Protect Bloggers -

href=\"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/28703/info\">this so-called alert on Security Focus</a> appears to be completely false and has no information that an attacker or the WordPress developers could use. It is completely content-free, except for making claims that every version of WP since 2.0 is vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Online, apparently, it&#8217;s fine for someone to run into a crowded theatre and yell &#8220;fire&#8221; and the less basis there is in fact the more people link to them. It&#8217;s not uncommon to see crying-wolf reports like the above several times in a week, and a big part of what the WP security team is sifting through things to see what&#8217;s valid or not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/490402\">A valid security report looks like this</a>, it usually includes sample code and a detailed description of the problem. The WP security team was notified of the KSES problem and it was fixed in 2.5. You can impress your friends by saying whether a security report is valid or not, so it&#8217;s a good critical facility to pick up.</p>\n<p>All that said, there is a wave of attacks going around targeting <em>old</em> WordPress blogs, particularly those on the 2.1 or 2.2 branch. They&#8217;re exploiting problems that have been fixed for a year or more. This typically manifests itself through hidden spam being put on your site, either in the post or in a directory, and people notice when they get dropped from Google. (Google will drop your site if it contains links they consider spammy, you&#8217;ll remember this is one of the <a href=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/12/on-sponsored-themes/\">main reasons I came out against sponsored themes</a>.) Google has some guidelines as well, <a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/04/my-sites-been-hacked-now-what.html\">what to do if your site is hacked</a>. If I were to suggest WordPress-specific ones, I would say:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-5198\"></span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Upgrade your blog to the latest WP.</strong> This <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> be hard. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade/\">There are plugins for it</a>, if you&#8217;re techy <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion\">use Subversion</a>, <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress\">there is the standard FTP method</a>, and finally <a href=\"http://mediatemple.net/\">Media Temple</a>, <a href=\"http://dreamhost.com/\">Dreamhost</a>, and <a href=\"http://bluehost.com/\">Bluehost</a> (through SimpleScripts) all have been pretty good about having their one-click upgrade systems ready with new versions within a day or two of a release. If your host is chronically behind, vote with your wallet and switch.\n<ul>\n<li>If you need someone to help you upgrade, consider <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-pro\">hiring help on the wp-pro mailing list</a>. (It has close to a thousand subscribers and consultants on it.) Or you could always ply a geeky friend with caffeine, libations, food, or gadgets. Just get them to setup a system lik the above so you can do it yourself next time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Change your passwords</strong>, for yourself and any other users you have on the system. If the attacker grabbed your password when you were on an old version, they can still log in after you&#8217;ve upgraded if you don&#8217;t change it. There&#8217;s a new password strength meter in 2.5 helps you pick a good password.</li>\n<li><strong>Search through your posts</strong> for any that might have been modified, and comb through the directories on your web server looking for anything out of the ordinary. Your host may be able to help you with the latter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on the latest version, you&#8217;ve changed all your passwords, and something still happens to your blog, don&#8217;t panic. It&#8217;s not your (or WP&#8217;s) fault, but there is likely another account on the server which is malicious and the server you&#8217;re on is set up in a way that your neighbors can modify your files. The best thing to do here is to contact your host or sysadmin and have them check things out. They can look at the other accounts and log files in a forensic fashion to identify and find the source.</p>\n<p>I follow or am involved with many, many WordPress blogs - some that receive millions of pageviews a day and have pageranks of 8 or 9 and are huge targets all the way to small personal blogs. Those that have followed the two basic tenets &#8212; keep up with upgrades and use good passwords &#8212; <strong>have <em>never</em> had a problem</strong>. Those that fall behind upgrades, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2007/11/al-gore-hacked/\">like Al Gore did</a>, have.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re tech-savvy, take a look through your blogroll and see if anyone is on an old version. If they are, consider contacting them to help out. Like a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_raising\">barn raising</a>, if we all work together it&#8217;ll happen a lot faster.</p>\n<p>I often hear reasons why people don&#8217;t want to upgrade, here&#8217;s the most common and my best response:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m scared something will break, or I don&#8217;t know how.</strong> Ask a friend to help or hire a professional on the aforementioned wp-pro list. Long-term, try to use a plugin like WPAU or a host that will do upgrades.</li>\n<li><strong>One of my plugins doesn&#8217;t work with the new version.</strong> This is getting rarer as we have a very public testing cycle for plugin authors to try their stuff with the latest version, but still common. I would suggest checking for an upgrade to the plugin on the author&#8217;s site, contacting the author about the incompatibility you found, maybe even donate some money, or finally search for an alternative plugin that provides similar functionality but works with the latest and greatest version of WordPress. In the big picture, though, having a secure site is much more important than the functionality of a single plugin, so you should seriously consider turning off a plugin for a few days instead of putting off core upgrades.</li>\n<li><strong>I don&#8217;t like the new version, they moved my cheese.</strong> We believe every new release is better, but sometimes people just aren&#8217;t comfortable with a change, which is fine. The good news is that we constantly improve things based on feedback, including interfaces, and that more importantly for almost everything you can imagine annoying you there is a plugin that changes it. For example in 2.5 the page is fixed-width to allow for greater readability, but <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/remove-max-width/\">there&#8217;s a plugin to make it stretch to the full width of the window</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>I modified core files, so upgrades are hard.</strong> You should <em>never ever</em> modify core files in WP. If you find you have to, <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/\">file a ticket</a> for a new hook or filter so your modifications can be a plugin &#8212; it makes things so much easier.</li>\n<li><strong>Upgrades are too frequent.</strong> If it takes you more than 5 minutes to upgrade your blog, <a href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.com/category/wrong/\">you&#8217;re doing it wrong</a>. Historically we do a major release about 3 times a year, and a minor release about once a month. Minor releases almost never break anything, so they are the easiest. (And often the most important.) WordPress is fast-evolving software, so this is a good problem to have.</li>\n<li><strong>I don&#8217;t know when there&#8217;s an upgrade. </strong>No excuses here. Since 2.3 we include a big honking notice at the top of your dashboard when there&#8217;s a new release available. It&#8217;s also worth subscribing to our <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/\">dev blog</a>, it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s going to flood your RSS reader.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course the millions of blogs on WordPress.com never worry about any of this, nor do the folks on good hosts that have one-click upgrades. The WP community takes security very seriously and has always done its best to respond diligently to any known problems, but all that work is for naught if you don&#8217;t upgrade. Hosting an application yourself is a responsibility. In the future we&#8217;re hoping to make this whole thing easier, for example with built-in functionality like WPAU. Until that day though, I hope the above helps.

Last week we were 1 day late, but hopefully today will be the forerunner to a multitude of blog entries to follow.  With that being said, let’s get down to business.\r\n\r\nThere’s been a few occurrences in our life of late as far as I’m concerned. <img src=\"http://images.burningones.com/newDucks/1.jpg\" alt=\"New Duckies\" align=\"right\" height=\"59\" width=\"120\" />Just prior to mother’s day we officially welcomed some new life into the world in the form of 8 little ducklings (or as I have been affectionately calling them, duckies...).  I believe that these duckies were first observed swimming around the pool behind their mommy on Saturday morning.  It’s been a long time since I’ve gotten to witness new life as it first began to experience the world and the site was truly moving.  Just in case your interested there is a (rather sizeable) <a href=\"http://video.burningones.com/newDucks/newDuckiesAtTheBiddleHouse.mov\" title=\"New Duckies at the Biddle House\">movie</a> that I shot and edited for your viewing pleasure should you desire to see the duckies in action.\r\n\r\nI was struck again by the grave sin of man to look at a world as complex and beautiful as ours is and, in his desperate attempt to deny God and rule himself, declare that it was only chance that accomplished this great feat of creation.  You cannot observe the miracle of renewed life every year and honestly say that there is not a God.  As Charnock might say, it is a great folly for the atheist to deny the existence of a divinity, thought it may not be so outlandish for him to claim that the divinity is not the Christian one.  However, the existence of God truly is painted upon every facet of his creation.  I pray that God would help me to continue to marvel at the works of his hands and to be moved to worship him at every turn in his world.\r\n\r\nI’ve also been lead again to the extreme importance of effective use of my time.  I had a dream recently that I was in a car on a major highway and that I could not control the car.  I wasted a large amount of energy because I would just randomly begin to swerve all over the highway and eventually I would be pulled over and taken back to the beginning where I would have to begin to drive again.  God was telling me that I need to start reigning in my passions and begin to focus my energies on the \"one thing needed\" (Luke 10:41).  So I recently totally reexamined my schedule and have been attempting to follow it with renewed vigor.  I want it to be said of me when I stand before God that I was an anointed communicator of Biblical Truths and that my heart swelled at the thought of my Lord.  So I’ve attempted to align my schedule to aim at that end.  I also believe that God has called me to be an excellent web designer so I’ve included that into my schedule.\r\n\r\nThe use of our life energies will be directed by someone, whether it’s me or the Devil.  God has a dream for my life but he wants me to chase after it with my own free will.  It brings him glory when the dream that he has for me is what ignites my heart to passionate pursuit.  Therefore, that is how I want to order my life.  Beyond that, as a nod to purely selfish motives, I know that the things that God has for me are where I will truly be satisfied, no matter what this world or my mind has to say about it.  I’m in this to have my hunger and thirst quenched.\r\n\r\nRecently, Jess and I were rocked by a message from Lou Engle called \"The Call to Go Beyond Mediocrity\".  If you want to hear it, it was the most recent release (5/11/06) on the <a href=\"http://www.ihop.org/Group/Group.aspx?ID=1000005002\" title=\"One Thing Podcast\">OneThing Podcast</a>, so hook yourself up with that.  It’s a great resource anyway just for things to be feeding your spirit on, so I would recommend signing up for it just because.  Anyway, the message is really a call to Nazirite consecration in the face of a culture that downgrades utter devotion to God.  Our culture has bought into the lie that God is at best a thing that provides you with a warm fuzzy feeling and that until we’re “forced” to “bear with” his presence all day long, we should get all the enjoyment we can out of this world.  This is utter nonsense.  God created us to enjoy him.  He is the only thing that will bring us true pleasure.  Therefore, it is utterly insane to say that we should be well rounded individuals with God only occupying one of the many compartments of our lives.  I like what Lou Engle said; “We only have so much passion and energy.  If we’re called to love God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength, that doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for sports and other things.”  It’s the call to “fast the legitimate pleasures of this life in order to enlarge our capacity for the superior pleasures of God himself.”\r\n\r\nThe message really helped me and Jess understand what we\'ve been going through all of our lives.  I actually commented to her in one of our many conversations about it that I hadn’t connected with a message so much since the first time I had gone to One Thing.  Truly, Lou Engle has been given a message that is an echo of what God has placed in the hearts of my generation.  We’re sick and tired of dead religion that is lacking connection with the heart of God.  However, we’re not leaving the Church, we’re running in the Church.  We’re called to be John the Baptists.  We’re called to be burning and shining lamps (John 5:35).  Lou Engle said that it is always God’s way to raise up Nazirite lovers as an answer to Barren Mothers.  I’m happy that it is God who has released this utter dissatisfaction with the things of the world into me.  However, I now know that the call is high.  Because at any given moment I can choose to feed on the things of this world.\r\n\r\nYou see, I realized that the problem with movies is not that movies cause you to sin, it’s that movies give the devil ammo to use against you.  I recently watched The Greatest Game Ever Played.  Truly, there’s nothing in that movie that I would claim was immoral.  I would even say that as far as entertainment goes, that was about as clean as it comes now-a-days.  However, what I realized is that I could have taken those 2 hours and fed on something from eternity.  I could have listened to a message, or read my Bible, or prayed, or simply gone to sleep, and the images that I now have in my head would not be there.  My soul would have lacked the food that it now has that it is feeding on.  In other words, I could have fasted that movie (as far as I’m concerned, a legitimate pleasure... Unlike some movies) and fed my spirit.  This is the war.  It’s a battle over the gate of the eyes, and the question is what will we feed ourselves with.  Will we feed ourselves with junk that ultimately serves no purpose?  Or will we feed ourselves with eternity;  with that which strengthens our inner man instead of weakening it.\r\n\r\nGod, I pray that you would unleash dissatisfaction into my heart and the heart of my generation.  Show us where true pleasure lies.  Show us where the longing of our hearts can be answered.  Turn the pleasures of this life into ash in our mouth.  Incline our hearts to your truth, God.  Enlarge our capacity to feel and embrace you.  Set yourself as a seal upon our heart, stronger than death.  Burn us with a coal from your alter and set us apart.\r\n\r\nWell, I had more to say here but it’s just going to have to wait.  I’m gonna have to rethink how I do this because I just flat-out ran out of time.  Perhaps we’ll need to be more focussed in the future.  But at the moment I’m way over schedule, so, I gots to get goin!','Set Me Apart!',0,'','publish','open','open','','set-me-apart','','','2007-10-20 18:05:11','2007-10-20 22:05:11','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=3',0,'post','',0),(8,2,'2007-05-10 00:12:32','2007-05-10 04:12:32','So, what to say?\r\n\r\nWell, I suppose I could start about by just saying a formal welcome.  We don’t have a whole lot of content up here at this point and we really haven’t advertised the site but the meta informations all there so if you have some how found us through the internet then, <strong>WELCOME!</strong>\r\n\r\nOur hearts here (that’s Timmy and Jessie’s heart) are to do 3 things.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Keep everyone up to date with our life, which has become hopeless to do in any sort of a true person to person way because of how busy we are and how many people we want to keep in touch with.</li>\r\n	<li>Provide information about our ministry in Norristown and the Greater Philadelphia area.</li>\r\n	<li>Provide resources that we think are useful to have to everyone that we can.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIn keeping with that, I suppose I’ll just go ahead and start off with a brief update about my life.  Just as an aside, the way it looks like we’re trying to do this is to have me (Timmy) update the main blog once a week on Wednesday.  Jessie would then come along and update the main log every Sunday (or Saturday, she’s not really sure which one yet).  As you can see, so far that’s <em>not</em> been what’s happening so far.  At the moment, I’ve done a bunch of mini-enries (which should happen all along as I make small changes to the site and such) and Jess did one <em>really-teeny-weeny-small</em> entry because it was like midnight when she started to write it (I was there, I know!).  Anyway, back to what this paragraph started with next paragraph.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pictures.burningones.com/gallery2/\" alt=\"Rest In Peace Nibs\"><img src=\"http://images.burningones.com/ripNibs/small/nibs1.jpg\" alt=\"Nibs The Rat\" style=\"float: right; width: 160px; height: 120px\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMy life...  So, in this past week, a few different things have happened.  Probably the most important thing that happened is that my rat, Nibs, has officially died.  We’re going to get a photo gallery of him up here before too long (hopefully I’ll be able to work some PHP magic or use iPhoto’s HTML generator, but we’ll see) so you can all see his adorable little face and amazing achievements.  He lived a good life of around 2 and 1/2 years but in the end was getting progressively older (as we creatures do).  In the past 2 and 1/2 weeks he suffered 3 strokes, the last one being fatal.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty scary in the beginning just because we woke up that morning hearing what sounded like someone sawing wood out in the garage and we didn’t realize till we walked over to his cage but it was actually Nibs breathing.  He couldn’t move on his own and he was bleeding around his eyes and nose so we were pretty sure that he had a few hours tops.  I actually went out and dug his grave and everything that morning and then Jess went about her day and I actually sat in the room doing my Sabbath deal and just kind of waited for him to die.  He slowly began to get quieter and quieter and I just kind of assumed that he was slowly giving up.  Until he started <strong>Moving!</strong>.  He couldn’t move that well but he was up and about again.  The one thing that makes us feel better about ourselves is that we probably took better care of him than we ever had in his last 2 and 1/2 weeks.  But, now he’s gone.  I guess we can be thankful because it wasn’t as much of a shock to find him dead than it would have to just kind of wake and, <strong>boom</strong>, it hits you!  So, since I don’t believe that animals are spiritual beings Nibs’ little existence is over and he is no more.  It was fun having him though.  :)\r\n\r\nThe Global Bridegroom fast just ended yesterday as well.  I’m struggling with the idea of fasting and how you’re supposed to do it and why exactly you’re supposed to do it.  I’m way past the question of whether or not you’re “supposed” to do it.  I believe that it is an integral part of any Christians 101 walk with God.  However, I’m just honestly not sure where in the Bible that is concretely backed up and where in the Bible it prescribes how and when to fast.  It seems that things like the Daniel fast and water fasts and all that kind of stuff are more things that people have made extrapolations about over the years, which were then built upon by others and then on and on until you have what the usual fasting believer might think about the subject.  But when you actually look at the text that the people are saying they are going off of, it’s really general and unclear.  So, in light of that, I’ve just been trying to get leading from God on this.  I want to fast because I believe that it will help me to increase my spiritual hunger, but I’m just not sure how.\r\n\r\nI guess my main contention would be that it seems like the fasts of the Bible (the ones that were recorded, not the ones that seem to be actually spelled out) were all spontaneous expressions of the real spiritual hunger that was <em>already there</em>.  It wasn’t something that was taught and then just done.  It was the product of a man or woman of God being desperate to see his face.  So what does that mean today?  When the disciples of John and the Pharisees had the dispute about fasting, they wanted to know why Jesus’ disciples didn’t fast and Jesus said, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?.” (Matthew 9:14-17)  So in this text, it wasn’t as if Jesus and his disciples were actively fasting on a schedule or anything like that, because there was no reason to mourn yet.  In fact, as far as I can tell, the Pharisees and the Disciples of John were fasting on a schedule because they just thought that they were supposed to (and they had an issue with pride, obviously, but I’m not sure that was it).  The fact is that I’m not sure if fasting just to fast really does anything.  I think that the authentic fast is merely a product of a deep longing for God, not the root of that longing or even truly an element of that longing.  Does that make sense to anyone else?  We’ll see where all this goes.\r\n\r\nIn other news.  I’m officially done school for this semester.  I’ve got no idea how I’m doing except that I don’t think I did horribly well on my Spanish final this time around.  There was one section that I just drew an absolutely complete blank on.  Couple that with an altogether disappointing semester in Spanish and I’m gunning for a low C/high D.  That’s fairly awkward! :)  But my other classes went well, as far as I know, so that’s good.  However, since success in life isn’t defined by my grades I’m not too worried.  We’ll stand back up next semester, lord willing, and go at it again.\r\n\r\nIn general, me and Jess are really just trying to go for God with everything we’ve got.  We don’t want any part of our lives to be off-limits to him, or any passion of ours to be more important than him, or any act of ours to be without honor to him.  It’s been a really awesome journey so far, and we’re really just out of the gate as far as we’re concerned.  I have no idea where life with him will go, but I’m absolutely assured that it will be where I’m supposed to be.  I’m absolutely confident that absolute and total satisfaction lies in God.  I’m hungry, and when you strip away all the theological definitions and Biblical quotations and religious veils, that’s what it comes down to for all of us.  Hunger.  God has blessed me with a hunger that I know can’t be satisfied with anything but him.  So I’m going to go for him, weakly but in his grace I’m going to reach him.  He is good.\r\n\r\nYouth Group in Norristown is going very well.  I still feel very confident that me and Jess are where God wants us in regards to that.  We had what me and Jess both feel was our best event yet this past month, which was our second lock-in held at the Ark at Jarretown UMC.  We had about 15 kids show up this time, and all but two of them were out by around 5 am.  Me and Jess made it the whole night as usual (none of the other adults did).  This time around we decided to have a midnight Bible Study and Worship time which I thought went really well.  I talked about John 9, which at this point is probably my favorite passage in John, which is the book I’m studying and we’ve been studying in the youth group lately.  I’ve just begun to realize that so much of leadership is about constantly offering opportunities to act like Christ, do the things that Christ tells us to do, or just to be with Christ.  It’s not so much about checking up on the follow through until later on.  In the beginning, it’s just seeing who’s hungry.\r\n\r\nIt’s so interesting knowing that in around 2 months, our partner in ministry and life for nearly 7 years and his new wife who has been partnering with us for around 3 years now will be gone, and with them all of the things they added to our ministry.  I guess the most rocking part of the whole deal is that <a href=\"http://forthehour.com/\" alt=\"For The Hour\">Alex</a> has always been the somewhat de-facto leader of our group and with him gone it’s going to be a major transition from doing things many times under where <em>he</em> felt God was leading us to doing things mainly without any direction from Alex.  However, God has already been moving us in that direction as Alex and Jaclyn both have not felt any leading to work with us in the Youth Group and both of them have stepped down from most of their more prominent leadership roles at Open Arms.  So, the transition has already begun and I’m excited to see where God is going to take us all over the next few years.

If the people at <a href=”http://alistapart.com/”>A List Apart</a> know how to do anything, it’s to design <em>freakin’ awesome</em> websites, write really good articles, and ask really intelligent questions.  Kudos boys and girls!</p>\r\n<p>So, anybody who’s reading this humble blog of ours that is also involved in the Internet in some development way (no, the survey isn’t just for web designers, it’s also for people who are information architects and database designers, etc. etc. etc.), I would totally encourage you to click on the link above and take it yourself.

I cleaned out his cage today. I cried a lot when the first stroke happened but I think I handled his death alright. I got a little depressed when I noticed there was no cage... aka no more Nibs.</p>\r\n<p>Tomorrow is <a href=\"http://forthehour.com/\" alt=\"For The Hour\">Alex\'s</a> bachelor party. They\'re going golfing, Japanese Steakhousing, Philly Gaming, and then going and getting wings and Nachos (that\'s the part that I am especially jealous about- but no worries, Timmy said he\'d bring me back some wings).</p>\r\n<p>So right now I\'m asking myself \'why aren\'t I healed?\' but I figured that maybe God has a purpose for all of this. However, I\'m still trying to declare the whole \'I\'m healed\' thing \'cause I know it works (even though I haven\'t mastered the logics of it yet). But no worries, if my suffering serves some greater purpose, then God will heal me when I need to be healed, yay!</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I\'ve been thinking a lot about the whole concept of \'dying to yourself\' and trying to do it. I understand now that brokeness comes when you\'re dying to your flesh so much that it hurts and you start crying because of how miserable you are. I\'ve also begun to realize how big my pride and how much inadequacy I have to fix it. I suppose this is good but it doesn\'t change the fact that I stink with it and even now as I\'m typing I\'m thinking inwardly, \'don\'t I sound super-Christian? Someone should admire me.\' I\'m not kidding. If you were to sit in my head right now for a second you\'d come out with your fingers all pruny with my pride (and right there is false humility :-) see? I just can\'t get away from it, hehe. But I know God\'s perfecting me and it\'s all that matters. A highly recommendable book for discovering your hidden monster is \'Humility\' by Andrew Murray. I mean, I knew I struggled with it but I never realized I mostly consisted of it.</p>		\r\n<p>A second thing that God\'s really been dealing with me is dreams. I\'ve always been one of those people who dreams all night, every night. Well God recently revealed to me that what I thought were just odd synapses in my brain was really Him talking to me in 90% of my dreams. Which is down right amazing and I have no idea why God would be so gracious and do that for me! I totally don\'t deserve it (I really don\'t, I\'m not just trying to sound humble) and I take it for granted! He\'s been teaching me that dreams, much like in the Old Testament, are really just all about symbols and once you understand the symbols that God uses to communicate with you, it\'s totally doable (with the help of the Holy Spirit). I\'m not a dream interpreter or anything, but if any of you have questions on how to interpret your own dreams (I really believe every Christian should know how to) then don\'t hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:jess@burningones.com\" alt=\"e-mail Jessie\">e-mail me</a>.</p> \r\n<p>Ok!

It’s absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> outside :-) We had <a href=\"http://forthehour.com/\">Jaclyn’s</a> bachorlette party Friday and Saturday- we went to Six Flags. It was my first time and I thought it was a pretty impressive theme park. It’s huge! And we got some cool pictures with Bugs, Taz, and Porky the Pig :). <a href=\"http://images.burningones.com/Parties/SixFlags.jpg\"><img src=\"http://images.burningones.com/Parties/SixFlags.jpg\" alt=\"On a roller coaster at six flags\" width=\"25%\" style=\"float: right\" /></a>God was really with us the whole day in little ways. The tickets, which were originally $65, we got for <strong>$30</strong> because a rather suspicious lady approached us upon entering the park and offered to sell us her tickets. I was a little nervous at first, (especially when she pulled out 2000 tickets out from her stroller) but she offered to walk up to to the ticket place with us so I said sure and it turns out the tickets worked! Amy got her $15 lunch for free (the food distributor gave it to her and  told her “you just keep that beautiful smile on, girl”) and when we were looking for a table that wasn’t covered with rain a random man approaches us and shows us where a dry table was... and it really wasn’t like he was hitting on any of us- like he really just wanted to show us where a dry table was. Things like that happened all day, which was awesome! So even though we were entertaining ourselves all day in a park where it was far from God-focused, it was cool to see God blessing us.</p>\r\n<p>I had an awful morning because I’m tired of pressing on and persevering. And I was writing my dreams down and I just have no idea how to interpret them, and it’s been like that for a couple of days now, and I just didn’t want to give my morning to God so I threw my book across the room and made sure I took a shower to spite God. I feel like I have three things I could do... I could go back to what I used to do and waste my day watching TV, working on scrapbooks, cleaning... just doing things that might be ok but don’t really profit me anything, or, option number two, I could sit around all day and worry about my relationship with God but not do anything about it (which is what I feel like I’m doing right now) or, my third option, I could press on and keep running. I think I’ll do that because it’s really the only one that leads to life, even though all three options are just as frustrating and I hate it. I’m wondering when the good will come. I feel like I must “put up with God” and He’ll give me something. “Look, God! I spent TWO hours muddling and thinking about these Scriptures... I think I’ve earned my cool, prophetic word now” isn’t that awful? I’m trying to break free of that mindset. I have to remind myself that God can’t love me anymore than He does and He’ll usually give me more when I don’t deserve it in spite of myself. Grrr.</p>\r\n<p>I want so badly to be the John the Baptist and I want it to happen yesterday (I think I could settle for today though, hehe). I want to burn with God Himself inside of me. I want the fullness of God and I feel like I have this huge boulder of pride in front of me. I’ve been told to speak to it so that’s what I’m trying to do but it just seems like its taking <em>forever</em>. But I’ll keep pressing on because I really don’t have a choice if I want to live, and I’m fine with that :-). I know that God isn’t some scary bear but a loving Father who loves me with an everlasting love. And I’m not doing Him any “favors” by putting “up” with Him, I just need Him and He upholds me by the power of His Word.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>...6-7 hours have passed...</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I don’t need to feel condemned!

Eventually, this place\'ll run like a well-oiled machine, but until then, have a little grace and a good sense of humor, and subscribe to us via the <a href=\"http://blog.burningones.com/rss.php?ver=2&amp;num=10\">RSS feed</a> for easier updates checking.</p>\r\n<p>So, my day today felt like a big gigantic waste of time.  I am a nerd in many ways and thus I get easily sucked in to things that promise me they will save me time, especially when they are tech-heavy.  That means that I spend a great deal of time using these time-saving gadgets and gizmos when I could instead be spending more time doing important things.  The latest thing that has been added to this list is a wonderful little program called <a href=\"http://www.utsire.com/shrook/\">Shrook</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.fondantfancies.com/images/shrook/screenshot2.gif\" width=\"25%\" alt=\"Snapshot of Shrook in action\" style=\"float: left; margin: 1em 2.5em 1em 0;\" />So, say hello to Shrook.  It\'s an RSS feed aggregator that lives on your computer and sinks with any number of RSS feeds.  That means that I can subscribe to any number of websites via their RSS feeds and automatically discover if they\'ve updated themselves at all since the last time I was there.  That\'s <em>great</em>, right?</p>\r\n<p>Problems:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>I\'m not discriminating enough in what I choose to read.</li>\r\n	<li>I get interested in <strong>WAY</strong> to many feeds.</li>\r\n	<li>When I do bother reading them, I spend <em>all day doing it</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>So, I now have this beautiful RSS feed aggregator that\'s free and beautiful and easy to use that promises to save me time and effort in checking up on websites, only to turn around and make it easier for me to check 10 times as many websites and use 10 times more of my, well, time in the doing of it.  Useful?  I think not&amp;#8230;</p>\r\n<p>I have a few options in my approach to this.  I can:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Become more discriminating in choosing what to read.  This would involve learning to be a better inspectional reader (Thank you <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Touchstone/dp/0671212095\">How to Read a Book</a>).</li>\r\n	<li>Subscribe to way fewer RSS Feeds</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>At the moment, I\'m probably going to go with the second option up there, as I simply cannot afford to spend the kind of time I did today reading them anymore.  So, I\'d rather subscribe to 10 or so high quality feeds that have content that I <em>should</em> be reading and attempt to choose discriminately among them, and then if I become very good, slowly begin to add more.  I\'m basically interested in web design information, web standards information, Christianity related information, and world news information.  If you have any suggestions of websites that I should check out, feel free to leave us a note here on the blog</p>\r\n<p><em>Moving on&amp;#8230;</em></p>\r\n<p>So, the title of this blog entry is \"God steals my golf balls, and I love him for it!\"  And honestly, I\'m being totally serious.  Lately, I have re-taken up the sport of Golf.  If you don\'t consider it to be a sport, that\'s tough.  I think it\'s a sport whether you like it or not.  For <a href=\"http://forthehour.com/\">Alex\'s</a> Bachelor party, we took him out golfing in the morning, and that\'s where it all happened.  I\'ve golfed for most of my life.  Well, that\'s probably not totally true, we\'ll say I\'ve golfed since I was in around fifth grade.  I <em>really</em> enjoy the game of golf.  There\'s something about it\'s elegance that really intrigues me.  I despise golf culture, and probably would not play on a super-high-quality-country-club-esque course simply on principle, but the fact that you get such crazy cool results from a swing that requires intricate and minute adjustments almost every time you do it is fun to me.  It\'s like aiming towards perfection, even though you know you\'ll never get there.  Ok, enough waxing.</p>\r\n<p>I enjoy the game of golf, but I haven\'t really played much for over a year.  I\'m not the kind of golfer that will for the most part attempt to play year round some how.  Even though that\'s possible, it\'s just too expensive and too impractical and too time consuming.  So, I golf throughout the summer and then the golfing bug moves into someone else brain.  This year around, it came back in a big way, and it brought its family too.</p>\r\n<p>Ever since Alex\'s bachelor party, I have consistently been golfing almost every day.  No, I don\'t go out to the driving range every day but for my &amp;#8220;breaks&amp;#8221; I go out to the backyard at the the Biddle\'s house and wack a golf ball around until a lose it.  This usually takes me roughly 30 to 45 minutes, even though in my head it always takes me 10 to 15.  The funny part is, as I\'ve been attempting to go deeper still with God, I\'ve been loosing golf balls very quickly, and only when I know that I\'m not supposed to be out playing golf at that time.</p>\r\n<p>Has that ever happened to you?  You\'re on your way to doing something and you haven\'t bothered to ask God about it and suddenly you feel in your spirit, &amp;#8220;this is totally not what I\'m supposed to be doing right now.&amp;#8221;  That happens to me sometimes, not often, but it does happen to me.  And lately the most often time that it has been happening is when I go to play golf.  However, I\'m a stubborn oaf and I say to myself, &amp;#8220;OK God, I\'ll only hit the golf ball up the yard and back and then I\'ll stop.  Thanks for the tip though.&amp;#8221;  Hopefully, as you read that statement, your face kind of cringed up like you were watching an episode of America\'s Funniest Home Videos, because it\'s a pretty dumb thing to say, especially when you\'re dealing with God!</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, inevitably in those situations my first shot&amp;#8212;don\'t get me wrong.  I don\'t think that I\'m some sort of super-great golfer, but I usually can hit the ball fairly straight, especially when I\'m not full out swinging.  And if I don\'t hit the ball fairly straight, it usually just means that I topped it so it goes skipping off across the ground some where.  OK, so inevitably in those situations, my first shot literally flies out of the yard every time, in ways that shouldn\'t even be possible.  I\'m talking, I hit the ball in a way I never did before to make it go out of the yard.  Or, worse yet, I hit the ball 10 feet away and walk towards it only to discover that it\'s nowhere to be found.  It\'s really pretty incredible.  And every single time, right after I lose the ball, I feel God do his little nudge thing in my spirit and say, &amp;#8220;Would you like to go do what you\'re supposed to do now?&amp;#8221;  So I go back inside with my tail between my legs and a smile on my face, knowing that God cares enough about my day to day activities that he won\'t let a fun, albeit fairly useless activity such as golf ruin my day if he knows that it shouldn\'t that day.</p>\r\n<p>I guess the conclusion of this is that I\'m really excited about where me and Jess are going with God.  We\'ve connected with <a href=\"http://fastandpray.com/\">Lou Engle</a> (as has been previously said in a <a href=\"http://blog.burningones.com/?postid=3\">post</a>) in a major way in our hearts and we\'re thrilled that the 40 day nation-wide fast has finally started (for those of you who don\'t know, it began May 28<sup>th</sup>.  It\'s not to late to start!).  Both of us are so sick of being so cold hearted and so out of touch with God and we want more of him.  I almost did a little jig the first time it was revealed to me that God was stealing my golf balls because I realized that I had allowed him one step deeper into my life.  Yes, God is sovereign, but he has given us a level of dignity and personal responsibility in our lives that is unthinkable.  <em>He will only take us as far as we want to go, and as for me and my house, we want to go all the way.</em>  So, with that being said, I think I\'ll sign off for the night.</p>\r\n<p>May the Lord continue to consecrate us and make us into burning hearted lovers of him!</p>','God steals my golf balls, and I love him for it!',0,'','publish','open','open','','god-steals-my-golf-balls-and-i-love-him-for-it','','','2007-05-29 19:32:03','2007-05-29 23:32:03','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=24',0,'post','',0),(25,2,'2007-05-30 13:02:14','2007-05-30 17:02:14','<a href=\"http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/top-5-ways-to-build-a-wonderful-life/\">5, yea, 6 ways to live a happy life</a>\r\n\r\nJust found this wonderful little list of 5 ways to live a happy life, yea, 6 actions that will help you find that elusive quality of happiness.

I\'m vehemently anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-hate.  However, I\'m also a Christian and unlike many of my fellow believers I do believe in Universal and Absolute definitions of Sin.  One of those sins which I believe is clearly found in the Bible is that of Homosexual sexual relationships.  Now, that being said, I do not believe that homosexuals should be treated as second class citizens, I do not believe that the fact that their lifestyle is sinful means that they deserve love any less than I do or deserve judgement any more than I do.  We have all fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3).  Therefore, I have to question the wisdom of an Australian Gay Bar (That\'s how it describes itself) <em>winning</em> the right to <em>ban</em> heterosexuals from its premises.</p>\r\n<p>As a human being, I am offended when <em>any</em> group is discriminated against, and I find it to be uniquely counter-productive when the majority is repressed due to the minority\'s uncomfortableness with how the majority is reacting to it.  I think this way because when you repress the majority, it reinforces the thought in their head that the minority is different enough that it needs official protecting and thus it is actually inferior due to the fact that it needs something that we (the majority) do not need.  You see this with something like affirmative action which, though a noble effort to solve the problem of officially sanctioned racism, has in fact reinforced in the minds of many people (at least in my sampling of society) that minorities are worse than white americans because they need help.</p>\r\n<p>This is a complicated issue, and I do understand that in any free society it is a responsibility of the society to protect its minorities from the <em>tyranny</em> of the majority.  However, I think that when you legally begin to protect <em>aberrant</em> social sectors you almost remove part of their identity.  It\'s simply a fact that homosexuality, as of this point, is still considered to be somewhat <em>different</em> from the norm.  This is something that a homosexual person should be proud of as a member of that minority because it does give them a sense of uniqueness.  When I was much more outwardly punk than I am now, I gloried in the fact that society didn\'t <em>get</em> me, because I was different.  However, I suppose a lot of this comes down to the fact that I still think that homosexuality is something that is mainly the product of environment (a statement that is still hotly debated).  I chose to be a punk (even though at the time it didn\'t really feel like a choice) and therefore it made it much easier for me to accept when some one didn\'t accept me because I knew that I had chosen that path.  I suppose a homosexual person who never feels that they made a choice would be deeply hurt by society not accepting <em>who they are</em>&8230;</p>\r\n<p>So, all this boils back down to the inherent backwardness of a faction of society that is attempting to find equality and acceptance with its heterosexual brethren counting it as a <em>victory</em> that it has won the right to ban heterosexuals from its bar.  This does not do anything but reinforce the already present differences between the two communities.</p>','Is it counterproductive to reinforce differences?',0,'','publish','open','open','','is-it-counterproductive-to-reinforce-differences','','','2007-05-30 13:28:44','2007-05-30 17:28:44','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=27',0,'post','',0),(28,2,'2007-05-30 01:37:55','2007-05-30 05:37:55','<p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6685253.stm\">Nice little thought piece on online freedom</a></p>\r\n<p>With internet social networking services growing daily, it\'s interesting to see how governments and societies will begin to react to the unprecedented ability to share information&#8230;</p>','Freedom online',0,'','publish','open','open','','freedom-online','','','2007-05-30 01:37:55','2007-05-30 05:37:55','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=28',0,'post','',0),(29,2,'2007-05-30 13:31:46','2007-05-30 17:31:46','&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6639417.stm\"&gt;Facebook fears?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jeeze!  I didn\'t know that facebook caused so much of a ruckus!&lt;/p&gt;','Facebook Fears',0,'','publish','open','open','','facebook-fears','','','2007-05-30 13:31:46','2007-05-30 17:31:46','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=29',0,'post','',0),(30,2,'2007-05-30 14:14:24','2007-05-30 18:14:24','><p><a href=\"http://www.zeldman.com/2007/04/19/women-in-web-design/\">Women in Web Design</a></p>\r\n<p>Well, this is a really interesting article on how well women are being represented in the Web Design and larger IT work force.

Anyway, to sum up the message Bickle talked about Ephesians 5:18-19 and proposed/stated singing the Scriptures as the best way to get a burning heart. Now, even in my disobedience, I will always admit that there\'s <em>nothing</em> more I want than a total on-fire heart for God where He is my everything and my everything is in Him. So I tried it and I immediately got really tired and this image flashed in my head of a truck-load of these men in black shirts, pants, and sunglasses. I thought it was a little odd because it wasn\'t a scene from a movie or anything and I had never seen it before. But I brushed it off  because I was falling into that sleep-awake state as I was singing the Scriptures and it was probably some random image my brain produced (which is such a lie). But I realize now that God was trying to warn me that He had brought me into something new and the devil was bringing hell (demons) to my door.</p>\r\n<p>So the passed couple of days have been a hell ride! Ugh, it\'s been awful. I really felt God leading me to take Monday night prayer off and just spending the time with him and I feel <strong>SOO</strong> much better, but I was like uber attacked with all these lies that I\'ve totally been buying into. And now that I think about my dreams a few weeks ago were warning me of this, but of course you don\'t think of that when you feel like you\'re unloved, making no progress, abandoned, and just an annoyance to God. So I spent a good deal of my time ignoring God, crying all day, complaining to Timmy,  and staying away from getting Scripture into me because it just got too hard. So I just really got to get more truth into me over and over and over again until it comes out of my ears. And my whole pride issue wasn\'t helping this at all.</p>\r\n<p>Yesterday was our first anniversary :-) no, we didn\'t do the whole \"take the cake out of the freezer\" thing because:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>We\'re not really into the whole \"traditions\"... we\'d rather make our own.</li>\r\n<li>We\'re on a no meats-and-sweets fast.</li>\r\n<li>Timmy doesn\'t like cake.</li>\r\n<li>We didn\'t have a cake at our wedding, we had a choclate fondue fountain (which is highly recommendable). But had we had a cake the 1-3 would still apply.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Anyway! We spent the night hanging out (we went to one of our favorite Mexican restaurants) with Tim\'s older sister and her new boyfriend, Jesse (who we are VERY excited about and I end up praying for them a lot because my mind tends to get distracted when singing/praying Scripture and then I think of them and how happy I am for Katie and so I\'m like \"Oh, God! btw!\" hehe.</p>\r\n<p>Saturday was Alex and Jaclyn\'s wedding!!!!!!!

I didn\'t expect to feel like this. Maybe it\'s a small taste of what John the Baptist felt when his \"joy was full\" when the Christ, who he had spent his life preparing for, came. Let\'s hope :-). Jaclyn looked absolutely radiant (as she should- Alex is a great guy to marry).

They actually don\'t know how upset I am about it but that\'s ok (I\'m not one to really show emotions). They\'re in Disney World right now (so I\'m also kind of jealous because I\'d love to go on a vacation, hehe).

I\'ve decided I should probably start working out so I\'m going to commit to doing that Mondays and Thursdays and I am REALLY sore. I did a Billy Banks Tae Bo video and it just killed me.

I\'m actually trying to think of what I even did over the past week and I can\'t really think of much.  <img src=\"http://images.burningones.com/blog/reorganizedOffice.jpg\" width=\"240px\" style=\"float: right; padding: 1em 0em 1em 1em;\" alt=\"The Reorganized Office Space of Timmy V.\" />I\'ve redone the office (as pictured) and I think it\'s pretty sweet.  It\'s really quite amazing what the extra screen real estate let\'s you do.  Right now, I\'m using <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom\">Write Room</a> to write my blog entry and I\'ve got Terminal open with iChat and iTunes on the screen right next to me.  It would be nice if the big LCD display that I\'m using didn\'t have a huge mark on it, but that\'s ok.  It\'s better than being stuck at 1280x960 all the time.</p>\r\n<p>I finally finished the first discourse of <a href=\"http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?item_no=11124&amp;event=CFN\">The Existence and Attributes of God</a> by Stephen Charnock, which is awesome and amazing.  We organized the room, which was a complete and total disaster and it took us at least 2 or 3 days to complete because we just could never push all the way through it.  I did some more biking, which is super enjoyable and energy conscientious.  My bike is a bit of a disaster though, as it seems that almost every other ride something else breaks.  This last ride my gear cable for the rear drive train decided that it was time to snap, so I had to get that replaced today which cost me a whopping 35 bucks.  No fun!</p>\r\n<p>My older sister now officially has a boyfriend!!!  <strong>WOW!!!</strong>  I\'m so excited for her.  Jesse seems like a really great guy and I\'m just really happy for both of them.  Katie has been wanting to really settle down (not that she was living a wild life before, but she just hasn\'t really ever had a boyfriend that actually seemed like he would be a God given candidate for marriage) for a while now and I think that she is going to have a real testimony of God bringing 2 people together without much effort on either one of their part.  I think that is how it should be.  Eve was brought to Adam by God.  It seems kind of destructive whenever we attempt to \'hook ourselves up\' with each other.</p>\r\n<p>Also, today I had a <em>band practice</em>!  It was pretty insane and awesome and a great deal of fun.  It\'s been forever since I was in a pre-written band situation and it\'s been a very long time since I was playing the bass (as I have only been playing the guitar lately) and it\'s been an even longer time since I was playing any sort of hard music.  Needless to say, I didn\'t really know what I was getting myself into.  I showed up and my great friend Alan Popoli said, \'OK, here\'s your bass.  Let\'s start teaching you the song.\'  So off we went.  I think that even though I felt like I was hanging on by the seat of my pants most of the time, by the end of the night (we might have practiced for an hour, if that) I was actually doing pretty good.  The music was awesome nonetheless.  It kind of reminded me of very early Zao stuff (i.e. all else failed), which I love.  Alan was alternating between singing and playing the guitar (at this point he couldn\'t do both at the same time to well.  I don\'t blame, he was playing ridiculously complicated stuff as far as I\'m concerned.), and his two buddies (who I hope are now my two buddies) Andrew (Guitar) and Nick (Drums) (hope I\'ve gotten there names right, I\'m horrible at that) were just rockin out.  It\'ll be a long time before I can start to move again (I can barely play bass :) ) but I think this could really be awesome.  We\'ll see where it goes.</p>\r\n<p>So, like I said, it doesn\'t feel like we did a whole lot this past week, but I\'m exhausted nonetheless.  However, I\'m gonna try to get on to the meat of the post now.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Meditations</h4>\r\n<p>Recently, I\'ve been being tag-teamed by two books that have really been rocking my world (not including <em>The Book</em>, which is always in the process of rocking my world).  Probably about 6 or 7 months ago I was really feeling convicted that I was wasting my time with a lot of reading that I was doing.  The fact is that most books that are out today that are \'must reads\' will not be around in 100 years.  It\'s just how it is.  Most of the authors that we think are really important today will have no lasting impact.  History proves this.  So, as Leonard Ravenhill, I believe, said (allow me to very loosely paraphrase), \"Please don\'t buy any book until it\'s author is dead and buried and some measure of his or her life has been taken.  Otherwise, you\'re probably just going to be wasting your time.\"  I set out to fill my heart and mind with what has fed Christians for the past centuries, not the past year.  I appreciate current ministries (I\'m even fed very often by one called <a href=\"http://ihop.org/\">IHOP-KC</a> as well as others), it\'s just that stock has not been taken of their effects.  There are huge numbers of books out there that I have never touched that are <em>already proven</em>.  I figure that I should start there&#8230;</p>\r\n<p>I went out and bought a bunch of Christian Classics; books such as The Imitation of Christ, The Collected Works of Saint John of the Cross, The Interior Castle by Saint Teresa of Avila, Finney\'s Systematic Theology, Knowledge of the Holy by A. W. Tozer.  I\'ve basically been working my way through them ever since, and man do they deserve to be called classics.  In regards to the Bible I\'ve been studying Jesus (specifically the book of John); in regards to books I\'ve been studying God.  The last time I was up at a <a href=\"http://ihop.org/onething\">OneThing Leadership Summit</a>, Dwayne recommended a few different books but the only one I really felt lead to check into was The Existence and Attributes of God.  You know how it is when you see something and you feel a little nudge towards it in your spirit from God.  Anyway, I went to the book store and gave it a quick once over and decided immediately that I should buy it.  It\'s a really huge book and it\'s very dense so it takes a lot of effort to read (as most good books do) but I\'ve found every page to be totally worth it.  I\'m going to attempt to give you a little taste of Discourse Number 1 in the following few paragraphs and then we\'ll sign off.</p>\r\n<h4>The Existence and Attributes of God - Discourse Numero Uno</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://images.burningones.com/blog/existenceAndAttributesOfGodDiscourse1.jpg\" width=\"240px\" style=\"float: left; padding: 1em 1em 1em 0;\" alt=\"picture of timmy\'s notebook\" />As I said previously, The Existence and Attributes of God is a big long book dedicated to the long and loving meditation upon one subject, God.  It contains 9 discourses (basically huge chapters) that are all about God.  Something that the IHOPers have been saying lately is that the most neglected topic in the Christian religion is God.  No one preaches on God.  And yet he is the center of our faith.  Everything is from him and to him and by him, and yet we do not study him, and we do not think about him, and we do not meditate upon him.  I\'m fully convicted  by this statement.  I want to get to know God.  Let us proceed then</p>\r\n<p>Discourse Number 1 is entitled \'On The Existence of God\' and it centers around a discussion of the abject foolishness of not believing in <em>a</em> God (or higher power, or deity, or something supernatural).  Charnock does not yet even really get in to whether or not we should study and behold and meditate upon the Christian God, he only proceeds in great detail to <strong>slam</strong> the atheist.  I\'ll list some quotes below.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>For the first, every atheist is a grand fool&#8230; It is a folly; for though God be so inaccessible that we cannot know him perfectly, yet he is so much in the light, that we cannot be totally ignorant of him; as he cannot be comprehended in his essence, he cannot be unknown in his existence; it is as easy by reason to understand that he is, as it is difficult to know what he is.</p></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><p>The notices of God are as intelligible to us by reason, as any object in the world; he is written in every letter.</p></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><p>It hath been universally assented to by the judgments and practices of all nations in the world&#8230; The notion of the existence of a Deity was the same in all, Indians as well as Britons, Americans as well as Jews&#8230;\'Tis so twisted with reason that a man cannot be accounted rational, unless he own an object of religion; therefore he that understands not this, renounceth his humanity when he renounceth a Divinity&#8230; It hath been owned by the wise and ignorant, by the learned and stupid, by those who had no other guide but the dimmest light of nature, as well as those whose candles were snuffed by a more polite education, and that without any solemn debate and contention.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>There\'s plenty more where that comes from, but I don\'t even have time to get into it.  At a later date I will publish some more thoughts on this book but for now I\'ll just give you the broad strokes.  Besides being a slam of the atheist, the first discourse serves as a meditation on the simple fact that God is, and the profound joy that simple fact should bring to us.  I think that the chief thing that I have brought away from this so far is that I have become jaded in my education.  This is something that Tozer and Charnock have done particulary well in their tag-teaming of me.  Both of them, though they seem to be <em>extremely</em> intelligent men, have no fear of taking the humble road and admitting that we as humans know next to nothing.</p>\r\n<p>Through my education I have allowed something as ridiculous and incomprehensible as a seed growing from germ to tree to pass over me as if it were something I could account for in my limited reasoning.  I\'ve been convicted anew that Science at its best is nothing but a highly detailed method of describing what we can see.  We can truly account for nothing.  We cannot answer any question that goes beyond \"how would you describe what you are seeing?\".  How does the tree grow?  We can go as far as describing the little atoms interacting with each other but why do the little atoms work together?  We can observe the things that happen most often and call them laws but why do the laws exist and what makes them constant?  Just because we can see what happens does not mean we understand what is happening.  It is man at his most arrogant when we look at the vast complexity of the world in which we live and say that we understand what is going on.  It is evidence of the vastly depraved nature of the human race that we look at our universe and declare that chance did it.  That declaration is rooted in the fact that we desperately want to be our own master.  We desperately want to deny God.</p>\r\n<p>I might say that Charnock\'s main point in Discourse 1 is that belief in the existence of a God is <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> just an issue of faith.  Belief in the Christian God is and can only come to us via revelation, but belief in a God that is some how controlling things providentially and keeping the universe in order becomes more and more obvious the more you think about the complexity of the world.  I\'ll attempt to quote Thomas Carlyle via Tozer here:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Thomas Carlyle, following Plato, pictures a man, a deep pagan thinker, who had grown to maturity in some hidden cave and is brought out suddenly to see the sun rise.  \'What would his wonder be,\' exclaims Carlyle, \'his rapt astonishment at the sight we daily witness with indifference!  With the free, open sense of a child, yet with the ripe faculty of a man, his whole heart would be kindled by that sight&#8230; This green flowery rock-built earth, the trees, the mountains, rivers, many-sounding seas; that great deep sea of azure that swims overhead; the winds sweeping through it; the black cloud fashioning itself together, now pouring out fire, now hail and rain; what is it? Ay, what?  At bottom we do not yet know; we can never know at all.\'</p>\r\n<p>How different are we who have grown used to it, who have become jaded with a satiety of wonder.  \' It is not by our superior insight that we escape the difficulty,\' says Carlyle, \'it is by our superior levity, our inattention, our want of insight.  It is by not thinking that we cease to wonder at it&#8230; We call that fire of the black thundercloud \'electricity,\' and lecture learnedly about it, and grind the like of it out of glass and silk: but what is it?  Whence comes it?  Whither goes it?  Science has done much for us; but it is a poor science that would hide from us the great deep sacred infinitude of Nescience, whither we can never penetrate, on which all science swims as a mere superficial film.  This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle;  wonderful, inscrutable, magical and more, to whosoever will think of it.\'</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>With that thought, I\'ll close out for tonight and go have a wonderful sleep with my wife.</p>\r\n<p>I love you guys!</p>','On the Existence of God',0,'','publish','open','open','','on-the-existence-of-god','','','2007-06-07 00:37:53','2007-06-07 04:37:53','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=40',0,'post','',0),(41,2,'2007-06-07 12:07:56','2007-06-07 16:07:56','<p>Well, I\'m told that the first time you get spammed on your blog, it means that you\'ve started your rise to fame.

I\'m less than 24 hours away from leaving some of the best friends I\'ve ever had and, honestly, I\'m a little scared about the whole thing.  So much in my life has changed lately, and I\'m just really not sure whether or not I\'m ready to go through this too.\r\n\r\nJust a quick recap for all who are unaware.  My Mom passed away just over a month ago.  It\'s crazy even to think about that.  Most of the time I feel like it happened decades ago in some distant past that I can barely remember, but every once and awhile it really hits me again and I just start to cry.  I really miss her.\r\n\r\nWhen that happened, I was just about to start work at my new job with the department of treasury.  I started a few days late and after those days I really just turned around and said that if I didn\'t start then, I didn\'t know when I would.  So life went on...  as I suppose it has too.\r\n\r\nAll of my systems have been disrupted.  Church in strange, Monday Night Prayer has been shotty, Youth Group\'s been non-existent, work has become a full-time thing...  And to top it all off, Alex and Jaclyn have now moved.  Officially.  Finally.  For real.\r\n\r\nI\'m just starting to get the sense that this time isn\'t like the others, and that when I get on the plane that\'s headed for home tomorrow, I won\'t be doing anything but talking on the phone with them for multiple months.  That even when we do talk, the common bond of activity that we\'ve shared over the years will no longer be there, and we\'ll be sharing stories rather than sharing moments of interaction.  That as much as I want to be, I won\'t be involved in what they\'re doing and as much as they may want to be, they won\'t be involved in what we\'re doing.  I don\'t know how I\'ll hold up to the transition.\r\n\r\nSo, life goes on much as it has always gone on, full of it\'s own comings and goings.  I guess all I can do right now is just keep moving.  I love my friends dearly, and I\'ll miss them sorely;  I\'m just hoping that distant want curb either of those two things.\r\n\r\nWhen Alex and Jaclyn first approached us and told us that they felt that God was calling them out to Kansas City, Alex said something that has not left me and has been my prayer through this whole process.  He said, \"I feel like God wants us to be closer when we leave each other than we ever have been before.\"  I said amen then, and as I look at how things are going now, I know...  God answered our prayer.\r\n\r\nThank you God, for giving me the gift of friendship with these two people.  May you help it to continue.','It&rsquo;s been awhile&hellip;\r\n',0,'','publish','open','open','','its-been-awhile','','','2007-10-21 01:39:35','2007-10-21 05:39:35','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=42',0,'post','',0),(43,2,'2007-06-14 13:49:55','2007-06-14 17:49:55','<p>Well, slowly slowly this site is coming up to being ready for full deployment.

I\'ve been struggling to focus and get to sleep on time and all that stuff and it&#8217;s just been ridiculous.  Lauren\'s Graduation was a ton of fun but it certainly ate up a ton of time.  However, it was still really awesome to see my cousins and aunt and uncle and grandad and other uncle and hang out with Jesse (for an extended period of time&#8230; He&#8217;s such an awesome guy!  I\'m so happy for Katie!) and my sisters and my dad (I missed my mom but I think she had a good weekend&#8230;).

I\'m so unworthy of his kindness and yet time and time again he just meets me in my quiet times with him and tells me how much he loves me and how much he approves of me and I&#8217;m talking I&#8217;m a wicked, sinful, ungrateful, no good, poor, pitiable, blind, and naked guy and he just loves on me all day long.  It&#8217s unreal.</p>\r\n<p>So, that being said, no cool theological points this week.

I&#8217;ve been struggling with the concept of rejoicing in my sufferings.  Please understand that I know that what I go through is not even worth comparing with the suffering that the persecuted Church goes through on a daily basis around the world.  I understand and attempt to appreciate the tremendous blessing of living in a country where I am free to express my faith without fear of much more than people laughing at me.  But, in fact, that is kind of what my current thoughts have been about&#8230;</p>\r\n<p>I know that I am to rejoice in my sufferings knowing that they will in the end produce endurance, character, and non-shame producing hope.  However, currently, I find that I am suffering more because of my own shortcomings than because I am being persecuted by some outside force.  I quite simply have a quiet and ever-present understanding that I am not living up to the standard that my savior set when he came to this earth.  This causes me great consternation and pain.</p>\r\n<p>Don&#8217;t misunderstand me.  I do not believe that salvation comes by works or any such hogwash as that.  I understand that salvation comes by faith in Jesus alone, and that I am saved by grace through said faith resting solely on the unbelievable and unrelenting mercies of Father God.  This is not an issue of salvation (or that moment when I was made to realize that God had chosen me to be a part of his family, or my eternal security, etc. etc.), this is an issue of what I do now that I understand that God has blessed in that incomprehensible way and called me his own.  How am I living up to that call?</p>\r\n<p>Well, the answer is an undying, &#8220;<strong>NO!</strong>&#8221;  Of course I am not.  However, there are times when I feel that I have allowed God a little deeper and he has taken over a little more and I realize that I&#8217m obeying him a little easier and it brings my heart solace that I am not causing him to work something together for the good of those who love him and are called according to his purpose (in other words, me).  You see, I always want to be in the will of God because I know that when I&#8217;m walking in his will I&#8217;m actually participating in causing all things to work together for the good.  If I&#8217;m not walking in the perfect will of God, then I&#8217;m not helping, but instead, I am creating more of a need for God to work things out.  This brings me a tremendous amount of depression; of suffering.</p>\r\n<p>However, I don&#8217;t think that this is the kind of suffering that is supposed to bring me joy.  I don&#8217;t know&#8230; My own short comings are just that: short comings.  I should desire to stamp them out, right?  I should hate them with all of my heart, soul, mind, and strength as much as I should love the Lord my god with all of the same things.  How can I rejoice when I know that I am failing to live up to the calling with which God called me?</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, this was just a little thought ramble.  I don&#8217;t really know where it&#8217;s going yet.  Any thoughts, feel free to leave a comment or two.

I realized after my Mom died that somewhere along the way I had stopped having a simple <em>being</em> relationship with God and had begun to have <em>doing</em> relationship with him.  And of course, as time had gone on I had forgotten more and more what it felt like to be in a relationship with him that is any other way.</p>\r\n<p>When my Mom died, everything in my life went on hold.  I no longer was doing Monday Night Prayer, I was no longer doing Thursday Night Youth Group, and I even missed church 2 weeks in a row.  As all that activity passed away, I realized that I was desperately hungry and empty on the inside, and had been for quite some time.  I had only been distracting myself by all the doing.</p>\r\n<p>The terrible thing is that now that I\'ve realized that (it\'s been over a month), I can\'t seem to get back out of it.  It seems like for every time I sit there and try to make a good decision, I always do what I don\'t want to do.  And not in a way that quoting Paul makes OK.  I\'m not talking the high things, I\'m talking about just your normal every day stuff, liking talking with God for a few minutes or reading a passage of scripture.  I seem to be so overcome with a general malaise that I no longer seem to be able to work up any energy to fight against my flesh.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m just going to be really honest here for a second and lay my mind out on the line.  I\'m really angry at God because I don\'t understand why I seem to constantly have to motivate myself, and work something up in me, and create an urgency in me in order to be interested in him in any more than the usual walking relationship that I\'ve always had (at least, ever since I\'ve been saved) with him.  I feel like God is totally able to fascinate my heart and captivate my soul and I don\'t understand what he is gaining by leaving me so bored.  I make no bones about it.  I refuse to believe that I\'m some how not asking the right way or not having enough faith or even that it\'s not his will.  There is just the simple fact that I ask for fascination and motivation and God, on a regular basis, just seems to think that I\'m better off being bored and in anguish over the state of my life.</p>\r\n<p>That being said, I want to add a caveat, then I\'m going to go to bed.  I still love God, and I\'ve lost none of my faith in him.  But I\'m certainly going through a really hard time with him right now where he\'s really not revealing anything to me about what\'s going on and he certainly does not seem to be gracing me with his presence at all.  That being said, Lord Jesus, Come!  I want you so badly!  Please, don\'t let me loose that desire for you deep in my heart.  Now God, come over me in love and purify my heart!  I love you.</p>','Running on empty.',0,'','publish','open','open','','running-on-empty','','','2007-08-01 21:49:39','2007-08-02 01:49:39','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=47',0,'post','',0),(48,2,'2007-08-15 18:36:10','2007-08-15 22:36:10','<p>I\'ve found myself asking that question more and more lately.  The reason is because I feel very defeated at the moment.  I feel very much like I tried my very best to give it all to God, and I asked him to help me where I was deficient (which I was convinced was just about everywhere), and at the end of it all, I got nothing.  I had a few small victories here and there, but at the end of the day, I would sit there and struggle in my sin and be begging God to take the trial from me, admitting that I was not strong enough to overcome it on my own, that I would resist it as long as he would back my will up with means to accomplish that will, and then a few hours later find that I had failed.  Again.  Over and over and over again.</p>\r\n<p>But I would get back up and resist again, as best I could, after my fashion (which as far as I could make it was formed from a Biblical model).  I would resist and then fail, resist and then fail, resist and then fail.  And suddenly, I realized that I was resisting less and less, that I was getting more and more tired, that I was starting to lose faith that God would ever step in and \"take this cup from me.\"  This past Tuesday, I broke down completely, and when I encountered temptation, I found myself saying words like this.  \"What\'s the point?  If I resist now in a few hours I\'ll have been broken and I\'ll have given in.  Why not just give in immediately.  I\'ll hate myself just as much for doing it now as I will for doing it then.  I\'ll be just as disappointed, just as depressed, that I failed one more time, if I fail now or then.  I\'m through, I\'m not even going to bother God (who obviously doesn\'t have a plan to release me from this anyway) with my little pleas for help.  I\'m just going to give in.\"</p>\r\n<p>So I did.</p>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding the fact that a great majority of the above statement is a lie (God does have a plan to help me overcome my sin, I would be (and indeed I was) more disappointed in myself if I gave in without a fight than if I just gave in without trying, etc. etc.), it seemed to make sense at the time.  I was tired.  It wasn\'t only late at night, but I was emotionally tired.  I\'d been struggling deeply for awhile at that point and, like I said, every time I stumbled I seemed to not stand up quite as straight again, until I was finally walking along almost doubled over, just waiting to hit the dirt again.  When you\'re in that state, words and thoughts like that make a lot of sense.  It doesn\'t seem to matter (at least not to me) how much I quote the Bible or ask God for help or attempt to \"just decide\" to do the right the thing.  You just feel the inevitability of your sin and it breaks you in half.  You feel the enormity of your wickedness and it breaks your will to fight against it.  Anyway, that was last Tuesday.</p>\r\n<p>I was at church this Sunday and I decided to read through John.  It had been a little while since I had picked up that book and it has always brought me comfort.  John\'s unique view on Jesus and his words almost always bring me great comfort and refreshment.  I got to verse 5 and God told me to meditate on it for a little bit.  I\'ve always liked the verse; \"The light [Jesus] shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\"  However, I had always taken it very abstractly; the light was God(Jesus,Holy Spirit), the darkness was Satan and his forces.  I\'d never seen it in a personal light.  However, as I was thinking about it, I realized quite suddenly that the darkness was the darkness in me as well.  The darkness was my own sin and wickedness and evil nature. And then it hit me, my darkness has not and will never overcome the light that is now in me thanks to Jesus Christ.</p>\r\n<p>It may seem like a simple revelation, maybe even a thought that all baby Christians should be intimately familiar with, but some how I had either missed or forgotten that no matter how dark I am at any given point, Jesus shines in me, and his light cannot be overcome.  So, I\'m going to take comfort in that fact, and attempt to hope in the grace that God has for me; that he was willing to cause his son to dwell inside of dirty, disgusting, dark me.  And the very fact that Jesus is there is a guarantee that I will always have light in me, somewhere, even if I have done my best to hide it.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you Lord, for putting your light in me.  Help me to feel its presence always, that I would not allow myself to be disqualified when I become aware of the darkness dwelling inside of me as well.  I love you, Lord.</p>','What\'s the point?',0,'','publish','open','open','','whats-the-point','','','2007-08-15 18:36:10','2007-08-15 22:36:10','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=48',0,'post','',0),(49,2,'2007-08-17 20:35:13','2007-08-18 00:35:13','<p>OK, I just wanted to post this up here real quick.  Me and the wife take part in Wii Polls which is this nifty little feature of the Nintendo Wii which allows you and many other owners of Wiis to answer poll questions about many different things.  As near as I can tell the questions are not able to be used for sale to data mining companies which are attempting to figure out my generation so they can sell products to us, as the questions don\'t seem to be too revealing, but it is very interesting to see all the different answers as they then provide the poll results to you.  Most of the polls are on a national scale but some are world-wide and it is of one of these world-wide polls that I am writing.</p>\r\n<p>This past poll question was, \"Is this the TV your looking at right now a Wide-Screen TV or not?\".  Why am I mentioning this? you may ask.  Well, the results were quite astonishing as far as Jess and I were concerned.</p>\r\n<p>Now, barring the fact that this is a question asked to owners of the Wii (which obviously will skew the results quite a bit), I was fully expecting that the country with the highest rate of Wide-Screen-TV ownership would <em>easily</em> be the U.S.  I mean, come on, we have a reputation that would match that, no?

Oh, sure,  I\'ve been happy <em>with</em> things, but I can say with a dour pride that I\'ve never been content. And although so much of me wants to now say, \"but God\'s given me contentment! Amen!\" it would be a lie and I\'m more miserable than I\'ve ever been.</p> \r\n<p>I\'ve been having a sequence of dreams where I am punching Tim over and over again in the face because he does something that I find offensive and don\'t understand. Tim is a symbol for Jesus in most of my dreams and although a part of me finds it quite humorous that I would be punching Jesus in the face, a bigger part of me shudders and I am filled with both fear and remorse.</p>\r\n<p>God gave me the dream to help me realize that I am extremely angry at Him because I don\'t understand what He\'s doing. And that\'s where I am right now: angry.</p>\r\n<p>Here\'s the quote. Somebody finally knows what the hell I\'m going through: (I\'ll be adding in comments between paragraphs).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>\"Though lip service is paid to the gospel of grace, many Christians live as if it is only personal discipline and self-denial that will mold and perfect me.\"</em></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>For the past year I have sacrificed so much. So much. And I\'m not even talking about the fact that I quit college (for God)  and will refuse to work without an OK from God (for God). I\'m talking about the days spent fasting, praying- which reminds me-  did you know I would spend ten hours in the prayer room without a break? That\'s how freakin\' hardcore I was. I spent three hours every day speaking and singing Scripture over myself. I spent hours and hours reading my Bible and other Christian literature I thought God was leading me to. My dialogue wasn\'t \"I read X amount of chapters today,\" it was \"I read X amount of books of the Bible today.\" I made humility my goal and tried to live the Sermon on the Mount the best I could. I did everything and my pride is still just as big and I feel just as hopeless.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>To continue...</p> \r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>\"The emphasis is on what I do rather than on what God is doing. In this curious process God is a benign old spectator in the bleachers who cheers when I show up for the morning quiet time.</p> \r\n<p>Our eyes are not on God. At heart we are practicing Pelagians. We believe that we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps- indeed, we can do it ourselves.\"</em></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I started to be completely miserable when Tim\'s mom died and my whole glorious and \"radical\" routine was put on hold.</p>\r\n<p>And then I realized that it wasn\'t put on hold because it had to be. It was put on hold because I didn\'t want to do it anymore. I\'d much rather watch Will &amp; Grace, Sex in the City, Friends, Nickelodeon, Charmed, Law and Order, and crappy edgy PG-13 movies that shaped our American culture into the whore it is today.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>\"Sooner or later we are confronted with the painful truth of our inadequacy and insufficiency.

When I told Tim about it he got a word from God that \"winter was coming.\"</p>\r\n<p>I thought he was talking about a time in the wilderness in which case I felt honored and haughty because only really big, radical Christians go into the wilderness. But I was wrong. I am in a winter of discontent. I am filled with pessimism, despair and complacency. I just want to watch TV. Leave me alone. A couple weeks ago I had a dream of me standing in the midst of full-winter. I woke up and understood that this wasn\'t a wilderness that I had expected.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>\"It takes the form of boredom, drudgery.

I feel meaningless, pointless, purposeless and only worth what I can do.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>\"We secretly admit that the call of Jesus is too demanding, that surrender to the Spirit is beyond our reach.

Not necessarily a good thing, so far as I\'m concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found myself looking at some of things that Jess and I have written in the past on this blog and I realized that I would barely be willing to talk with most people (including very close friends) about some of this stuff.  It\'s got nothing to do really with my opinion of people.  It\'s that when you\'re talking with someone face-to-face, you\'re faced with an ugly reality that you\'re exposed.  There\'s no way to turn off a person.  When you get involved, you\'re involved till the bitter (or sometimes very sweet) end.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This begs the question, is what the web is doing to my ability to interact with others a good or bad thing.  On the one hand, issues that I have long kept secret are coming to the forefront, and one might say that this is a good thing.  Indeed, anyone of my friends that read this blog now have the opportunity to bring issues up with me that I haven\'t had the heart to bring up with them.  On the other hand, I\'m using an impersonal medium like a Blog to communicate deep issues of my heart to them.  This too, is no good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, in the beginning what the blog was supposed to be is an easy way to keep all the people that I want to keep updated updated.  In the end, this is a good thing, because with the size of our social circles growing, it\'s getting to be impossible to keep in touch with everyone personally.  In that way, blogs foster communication between people who would otherwise not really be able to communicate on a regular basis.  In fact, news on the blog might even encourage people to communicate with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this, there are millennia behind us where maintaining a huge, distributed circle of friends was simply impossible.  The fact just came down to people not having the time to maintain personal relationships with more than a few people (relatively speaking).  In that sense, a communication medium like a blog both helps and possibly hinders.  I can communicate more things to more people more easily via a blog than I have ever been able to before.  In theory, there is no limit to the amount of people who can subscribe to our blog and hear what\'s going on in our lives.  This is scary and cool all at the same time.  However, am I truly communicating with people, or am I only making information available for consumption?  I\'m not sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m not at this point, advocating a reduction in the size of our circle.  I\'m merely trying to think about the wisdom in having 600 Facebook friends and a blog that is mainly about informing people about our lives which also happens to be our main way of communicating with everyone.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I want to get off the computer now, as I\'m trying to quit using the darn thing so much ;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you think?

And all this time I thought I was made to be perfect.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m still trying to figure out how to \"feel\" like the ash that I am without being depressed about my sinful, hypocritical nature.<p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I felt very foolish this week when my aunt, Lynn, offered me a job at her after-school daycare from 2-6 during the school year. I was very excited about the offer, and even though I wasn\'t sure whether God wanted me to do it or not I was ecstatic about the risk of being wrong, probably being wrong, and then failing. But it would be ok and I wouldn\'t beat myself up about it because God actually might love me.</p>\r\n<p>Well, I might have led her onto thinking I was going to accept so when I actually prayed about it and got a very clear \"no\" I panicked and called her up and told her that I was sorry that I couldn\'t accept the invitation due to the fact that I don\'t have a car and thus my commitment would be lax. Well, she told me she could possibly let me use <em>her</em> car.</p> \r\n<p>Buggers.</p>\r\n<p>::shakes fist at God::</p>\r\n<p>So I called her back after a huge debate about it with Tim (who convinced me that it was actually wrong of me to lie) and I apologized for lying and asked her forgiveness... and told her that I had prayed about it and didn\'t feel right about it.</p> \r\n<p>Now, this has happened MANY times before in the past where I\'ve \"blamed\" God for not \"letting\" me do something. Everything from working for my grandmother for a day, eating dinner with my family and going to college. So this may add to their \"Jess-is-in-her-own-cult\" list.</p> \r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>This week we\'re watching the Ambrose (<a href=\"www.forthehour.com\">Jaclyn\'s</a> parent\'s) dog. His name is CJ. CJ is a Jack Russell and looks a surprisingly lot alike <a href=\"www.forthehour.com\">Alex and Jaclyn\'s</a> dog. It\'s been going ok.. a few minutes ago he just totally freaked me out by biting me (and I swear it\'s because I wouldn\'t give him any of my ice cream, even though Tim begs to differ), and barking at me. This made me think irrationally and the next thing I know I\'m calling Tim a stream of curse words because he won\'t take care of the dog while I\'m trying to write my blog.</p> \r\n<p>And then I cried and stormed off into the bathroom and took a 20 minute shower.</p> \r\n<p>But we made up. And then I cried some more because it turns out he was so worried about me he sat outside the bathroom and waited for me because I had locked him out and he was afraid I was hurt.</p> \r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Tomorrow the Visher family (Dad, Katie, Christina, Jesse, Jesse\'s parents) are coming over to barbeque and swim.

We\'ll see how I do.</p>\r\n<p>God has been highlighting an extremely simple thing to me lately.  <blockquote>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the the other.  For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.</blockquote>  I\'ve been gripped with an understanding that I am a sinner, and that I always will be.  I\'ve come to the conclusion that I\'d rather be a tax collector beating on my chest saying, \"God, HAVE MERCY ON ME!\" than to have all the pomp and glitter and self-assuredness that comes along with being one who is righteous.  I don\'t ever want to look at another human being like there anything less than I am.  This shouldn\'t be hard, because as far as I\'m concerned, I am the worst of all sinners.</p>\r\n<p>God is relentlessly kind to me.  Unceasingly kind!  He will not stop giving me grace.  And every time I tell him that I\'m not worth the price he paid for me and that I\'ll forget him in the next five minutes, he sits with me as I weep and puts his arm around me.  And then I go and forget him.  And I don\'t publish his glory to my friends and I don\'t tell of his mercy and forgiveness to everyone I see.  The fact is, I am the worst of sinners because despite God\'s relentless kindness towards me, I still find it in me to snub him at every turn. </p>\r\n<p>Part of my journey right now is allowing that to have it\'s perfect effect in me.  If I realize this, that God himself will never stop loving me, despite my failures and my out and out spitting and vomiting all over him in my sin and destitution, then it drives me to say, I don\'t have to be ashamed.  I\'m not disqualified by my sin today.  I\'m not disqualified because I have a terrible capacity for lust or because I loose my temper with my wife or because I become prideful around other Christians or because, secretly, I really think there will come a time when I don\'t need God anymore to be worthy.  God remembers that we\'re dust!  Our sin is <em>always</em> before him.  We don\'t shock him, we shock ourselves!  This allows me to run to God when I snubbed him a moment ago.  And I don\'t need to understand why he let\'s me do this!  I don\'t have to chide him and tell him he\'s giving me better than I deserve and that really, if he would take another look at me, he\'d send me to hell like I deserve and remove his grace from my head and allow my sin to be revealed to the world where I would be mocked and ridiculed and crucified like I should be.  I can\'t just rest, easy in the fact that he\'s chosen to love me, and I can\'t do a thing about it.</p>\r\n<p>I love him.  I\'m weak, and I\'ll forget him in 5 minutes and trade his glory for the works of my hands or some even more worthless thing.  But right now, I love him.

You are able to go places cars are not.  Yesterday, apparently, there was a massive accident on either Route 1 or I-95 that had traffic being diverted directly on the route that I take in to work.  If I had been in a car, I would have been forced to detour, which apparently took some of my co-workers over an hour given the volume of traffic attempting to get across the Boulevard.  However, because I was on my bike, I was able to cross the Route 1 with the blessings of the Police that were directing traffic.  An hour detour turned into a 30 second crossing.  That\'s not bad!</p>\r\n<p>As if that wasn\'t good enough, the township has been working on a major artery of my route to CHC for the past few weeks (which has made the ride a whole lot less enjoyable due to the horrible condition of the road) and today they finally had to make a big push so they closed down the whole road.  While cars went around to God knows where, I happily jumped onto the side walk and pedaled on past.  Again, where I might have gone 10 minutes out of my way, I was able to just move on and enjoy the commute.  Fun Fun!</p>\r\n<p>Look for more thoughts about biking in the coming weeks, as I\'m falling more and more in love with the bi-pedal commute</p>','One thing I love about Biking',0,'','publish','open','open','','one-thing-i-love-about-biking','','','2007-09-20 14:09:38','2007-09-20 18:09:38','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=70',0,'post','',0),(71,3,'2007-09-24 22:48:33','2007-09-25 02:48:33','<p>So I\'ve had an o.k. week, but a particularly good weekend, which leaves me with the feeling that the whole week was wonderful.</p>\r\n<p>God has been über good to me this week and has given me some revelations that I definitely should not be getting. One of them has been that God is a god of process and He certainly enjoys the process more than the finished product. So therefore I can find more joy in the race than at the finished line because I am made in the image of God.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve discovered that the goal is not to find out what God wants you to do, but to do everything for God. THAT JUST SOUNDED LIKE A BROTHER LAWRENCE QUOTE! ::pride... rising...::</p>\r\n<p>And, don\'t get me wrong, this week wasn\'t the best. For some odd reason Tim and I have been fighting at the end of almost every night. This results in either one of the following: <ol><li>We stay up for hours fighting, me crying, and then talking it out together (which Tim really shouldn\'t do because he has work or school in the morning).</li><li>Tim goes to bed and I stay up for a couple of hours into the night watching various episodes of Sex in the City (which I hate), Family Guy (which I hate that I find funny because it\'s such an awful show) and Friends. And then I crawl back into bed sobbing, wake up Tim, and tell him I\'m sorry.</li></ol> This week all the fights were 100% my fault and I really don\'t have anything else to say.</p>\r\n<p>But the weekend was fantastic. I feel like I\'ve been overwhelmed by the fact that I only see Tim (note I said \"see\" not \"spend time with\") three hours a night during the week and I thought the weekend would be the same but we spent all of it together and we had a really good time.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve been listening to a series of sermons called \"God is Green\" (which can be found <a href=\"http://marshill.org/teaching/index.php\">here</a>). And I just think it\'s stupid and arrogant that if everyone in the world would live like me, we would need FOUR earths to sustain everyone (this is called your ecological footprint and you can find yours <a href=\"http://www.earthday.net/footprint/index.asp\">here</a>). So with that being said I (and Tim) am making it my goal to live as simply as possible and to reorder my life to take care of my surroundings... even if I merely changed our light-bulbs to florescents or eat a  meal without meat... I understand that the whole thing is a gradual process but that still doesn\'t keep me from wanting to dive right into it and spend the week picking up trash from the side of the road. A lot of things I can\'t do (like turn the backyard into a garden) because we\'re still living with my parents. So throwing out all the paper towels and demanding that my mom use cloth for clean-up wouldn\'t be very good, even though I think it\'d be cool. So I encourage everyone who reads this to go the extra mile to pick up trash in the parking-lot or buy food at your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/\">local farmer\'s market</a>.</p>\r\n<p>So to those of you who have been praying for me I feel SO much happier with life in general and it\'s awesome because I can feel God so much more in my life than ever before. And I find that odd because I really haven\'t been fasting or reading my Bible. Maybe God doesn\'t care so much about those things as I thought.

One of the things that this class has begun to highlight to me through some of the models and mentors (especially Henri Nouwen, who I\'m growing to adore) is the need to be fully present in what we do.  I don\'t know about you, but I grew up just like most people in a frame of mind where everything that I did was about how fast I could get through it and how many other things I could do while getting it done.  If you\'d ask my wife, she\'d tell you that I\'m embarrassingly obsessed with attempting to do many things at once.  Obsessed to the point where I\'ll make us late to an important event because I just want to kick off one more task on my computer, or I\'ll stuff my bag full of things to do because I think there might be a chance to do some of it during whatever we\'re going to.  Everything I do I try to do with only enough attention to get it done quickly and efficiently.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s stupid.</p>\r\n<p>Ghandi said, <q>There\'s more to life than seeing how fast you can get through it.</q>  I\'ve been meditating upon that for a few days now.  Many of you might know that I\'ve been riding my bike lately as much as I can.  I\'m beginning to really enjoy it.  There\'s something about powering your own vehicle and being so close with what you\'re moving with that is very attractive to me.  I love getting up in the morning and putting on my biking stuff and then pushing off the steps in the front of our house and feeling the cool air on my face.  But to be honest with you, I\'ve been in a race to see how fast I could be.  I wanted to get my time down to the absolute minimum that I could.  I found that I was simply pedaling along as hard as I could for as long as I could with my eyes fixed blankly on the road ahead of me, blindly looking for spots that might trip me up and bumps I could avoid.</p>\r\n<p>I encountered that quote from Ghandi in my Models and Mentors class and it got me thinking.  I would be pedaling along and that line would come into my head.  <q>There\'s more to life than seeing how fast you can get through it.</q>  And I would realize that I don\'t need to see how fast I can get some place.  It\'s better to be a few minutes later to something and have been fully present along the way than it is to have been focussed on the future while the present was passing you by unnoticed and unthought of.  You see, I really, desperately want to wonder at God.  I want to be awestruck by him.  I want to encounter what he has done in Creation and in my life and be thrown down upon my face in worship.  And there\'s a simple fact; I cannot do this while I\'m in a rush.</p>\r\n<p>A quote that I love from Stephen Charnock is this (paraphrased), <q>It is not by thought that we loose our wonder, but by a lack of thought</q>.  I don\'t want that to happen to me.  I want to be fully present to what I am doing.  I want to be fully engaged with the person at church who comes up to me while I\'m doing sound and talks to me.  I want to be able to identify what\'s important in life and not be distracted.  An interesting post that got me thinking about how to do this in my own life was put up on <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/>Zen Habits</a> under <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/2007/09/haiku-productivity-the-fine-art-of-limiting-yourself-to-the-essential/\">Haiku Productivity</a>.  What Leo proposed, basically, was that in order to do anything well, we have to commit ourselves to only doing a few a things at 100% involvement.  <em>We will get less done!</em>  But it will be done better and we will experience it more.</p>\r\n<p>So, I\'m trying to commit to not multi-task anymore.  I\'m fine with committing some of my time to kicking off tasks that can be done without my attention.  But no longer will I be reading my e-mail and talking online and doing my homework and listening for my phone and and and&#8230;  I\'m going to do one thing at a time.  And I\'m going to be fully present to it.  I\'m going to attempt to slow down on my bike in the morning and look at the sun drenched trees that God made and the sparkling creeks and the people in their cars and wonder, how have I become so blessed as to see this?

But I can\'t deny the fact that since I\'ve stopped reading my Bible frequently and spent more time with my hands in the earth I\'ve felt closer to God.</p>\r\n<p>And I\'m kind of confused because this isn\'t what I was taught. Since I\'ve been reading books by people like Henri Nouwen and Brennan Manning, who teach that life is just about the love (of God), simple spiritual disciplines (that a child could do), and pouring your life into people. That for the most part Jesus spent his time eating and drinking (party-ing) with the people who are into drugs <em>again</em> after their 100th swear that they were clean. I mean, his first miracle was turning water into wine. Why would the son of God come to earth to give drunk people more drink? That was <em>not</em> a very pious move in my opinion.</p>\r\n<p>To be honest I\'ve always wanted to live in a commune with tens of other people, making my own clothes, growing my own food, letting strange people who don\'t have homes come in my house and eat their full. And my society has always written that off as a hippie movement that already happened. But, I dunno. Maybe that\'s how you experience God. Maybe it\'s not necessarily doing all these awesome religious works but just living life to the fullest of what it was meant to be.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>On a much lighter note we\'re leaving for Kansas City next Sunday at 6 AM- YAY!

The last thing you want to do is walk through life thoughtlessly, without being fully present.  For me, that usually means attempting to make as many things conscious activities rather than unconscious motions.  On to my new shame&#8230;</p>\r\n<p>This morning I got to school late because I slept too late and when I went to take a shower I got undressed and stepped into the shower and suddenly realized&#8230;</p>\r\n<p><strong>I still had my glasses on!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Shocked at myself, I slowly took my glasses off and opened the shower curtain and placed them on the little bench outside the stall and resumed my shower, thinking to myself, &#8217;&amp;ldquo;Wow, I hope I don\'t make a habit of this.&amp;rdquo;</p>','A Whole New Level of Thoughtless Living&#8230;',0,'','publish','open','open','','a-whole-new-level-of-thoughtless-living','','','2007-10-02 15:59:11','2007-10-02 19:59:11','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=74',0,'post','',0),(75,2,'2007-10-03 22:18:20','2007-10-04 02:18:20','<p>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a disturbing trend in my daily life since heading back to school that I\'d love to get out into the public.  I have begun to have a lot of trouble admitting that I don&amp;rsquo;t know something.  I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned a few times on this blog so far that I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to come off to anyone as better than I am.  I identify that desire to look better than you are with the Spirit of Phariseeism.  I desire to be the tax collector pounding my chest asking God for mercy, never once blinding myself and thinking that I&amp;rsquo;m better than another, because I&amp;rsquo;m not.</p>\r\n<p>This leads me to a particular pitfall that I believe I have been particularly susceptible to in my life.  This pitfall is the allure of knowledge, a sad siren singing it&amp;rsquo;s baleful song on campuses and in business centers and at our local caf&amp;eacute;s all throughout our post-modern, enlightened world.  I believe that the call connects with me so deeply because I believe that any self-respecting person is always learning.  This translates into me having a lack of respect for myself when I don&amp;rsquo;t know something already.  It&amp;rsquo;s a form of power.  &amp;ldquo;No one but me can teach me anything new.  I am my own instructor, learning for myself while disseminating information of my own to you plebians.&amp;rdquo;  I cannot tell you how many times I have found myself saying, &amp;ldquo;Umm&amp;hellip; Yeah, I can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember right now, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of that before.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, of course I know [what that means]&amp;mdash;[who that is]&amp;mdash;[how to do that]&amp;rdquo; while thinking to myself, &amp;ldquo;What are they talking about?&amp;rdquo;  The thing is, I believe that knowledge gives me power.</p>\r\n<p>But that&amp;rsquo;s just the thing&amp;hellip;  Knowledge does not give us power.  The fact is that elitism (where all knowledge seems to inevitably lead) provides what could most accurately be described as a false sense of security.  The Bible says that the Foolishness of God is greater than the Wisdom of man (I don&amp;rsquo;t know the reference).  Translating that negatively, The Wisdom of man is <em>less than</em> the foolishness of God.  Job says to God amidst God&amp;rsquo;s questioning of him, &amp;ldquo;I put my hand over my mouth, I cannot contend with you.  I questioned you once, but now I will sit down in the dust and accept that you are God and I am not.&amp;rdquo;  The fact is, humanism and enlightened thinking are fatally flawed paths.  Mankind cannot solve their own issues if given enough time.  If anything, we can and will only destroy ourselves, because at our root we are desperately blind fools.</p>\r\n<p>However, their is an alternate path that many of us don&amp;rsquo;t know about that I want to travel.  That path is the humility.  You see, Job was not ashamed because he had finally been confronted with the reality that he would forever be a child in the infancy of cognizance before almighty God.  Instead, Job realized what a humble person truly has; joy in the revelation that we are in the hands of a wise God.  We do not need to be wise, because God has filled that Gap.  There is a freedom that I hate to acknowledge in dependence.  &amp;ldquo;Beggars can&amp;rsquo;t be chooser&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; after all, can they?  But why would I want to be a chooser?  I would want to be a chooser because, for whatever reason, I believe I can make a good choice.  That I have it in me to look at the options and, with wisdom, choose the best option.  But I can&amp;rsquo;t.  I know someone who can.</p>\r\n<p>So, I want to begin to practice a joyful admission of my lack of knowledge.  I want to happily say to someone, truly with joy in my heart, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.  Tell me about it?&amp;rdquo;  One of my favorite movies is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_(film)\">Pi</a> by Darren Aronofsky, which is a movie about man&amp;rsquo;s trust in knowledge, as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned.  My favorite scene in the movie is after Max&amp;rsquo;s breakdown when he lost his faith in knowledge and accepted his human status.  The whole movie, Max never smiles, and he&amp;rsquo;s always on top of things because he&amp;rsquo;s just that smart.  You know what?  Max looks a lot better when he smiles.</p>\r\n<p>Enjoy the clip&amp;hellip;</p>\r\n<div style=\"margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\r\n<object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=1426517380852622559&amp;amp;hl=en\" width=\"400\" height=\"326\" id=\"VideoPlayback\">\r\n	<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=1426517380852622559&amp;amp;hl=en\" />\r\n	<param name=\"width\" value=\"400px\" />\r\n	<param name=\"height\" value=\"326px\" />\r\n	<param name=\"allowScriptAcess\" value=\"sameDomain\" />\r\n	<param name=\"quality\" value=\"best\" />\r\n	<param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\r\n	<param name=\"scale\" value=\"noScale\" />\r\n	<param name=\"salign\" value=\"TL\" />\r\n	<param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"playerMode=embedded\" />\r\n</object></div>','The Joy of Not Knowing',0,'','publish','open','open','','the-joy-of-not-knowing','','','2007-10-03 22:18:20','2007-10-04 02:18:20','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=75',0,'post','',0),(76,2,'2007-10-03 23:13:14','2007-10-04 03:13:14','<p>I\'ve been loosing about 2 pounds every 2 days over the past few weeks and then Jess took me to the Chinese buffet yesterday after I missed a few legs of riding due to bike breakdowns.</p>\r\n<p>Well, my cadence was broken alright.

Well, truthfully, he gave me his blog day... I didn\'t steal it.</p>\r\n<p>We got to Kansas City on Sunday (the 7th) morning and <a href=\"http://www.forthehour.com\">Alex and Jaclyn</a> met us at the airport and we hit up this really cool Chinese restaurant called <a href=\"http://www.bolings.com\"> Bo Lings</a> and they actually had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea\">Bubble Iced Tea</a>- which, if you\'ve never had, it\'s a really neat experience. I\'m not one for tea but I did enjoy the tapioca balls :-).</p>\r\n<p>It was nice being able to talk to Alex and Jac about everything in person instead of over a phone. We stayed with them until they kicked us out to make room for Alex\'s family, hehe.</p>\r\n<p>During the conference we stayed in an apartment across the street from Alex and Jac and although it was kinda odd sleeping in a bed of a couple you\'ve never met before it was definitely a gift from God not having to pay to stay somewhere. And it was SUPER nice of them to let us stay there without knowing us.. at all. The other one-of-many blessings on the trip was that the apartment was right across the street from IHOP so transporting ourselves wasn\'t an issue. The only downside of staying there was they have a cat and Tim and I are both allergic. So we just had to make sure we were constantly stocking our bodies up with Claritin :-).</p>\r\n<p>But the conference (well, it was actually called a \"Leadership Summit\") was amazing!! It\'s really less of a conference and more of an atmosphere to get refreshed and to connect with other leaders. We met people from Africa, Canada, Colorado, Florida, and Louisiana.</p>\r\n<p>The time of the prophetic ministry was probably the coolest though. I\'ve never had someone prophetically speak over me before. I was SO nervous... I could feel my pulse in my face! I kept having vivid images of a person sitting next to me and then after a minute of silence be like, \"I\'m sorry, God isn\'t telling me anything\" or \"Oh, my! Do you have enormous pride!\"</p> \r\n<p>They sit you in groups of 20 and place a tape-recorder next to you and when someone from the prophetic team has a word for you, they sit next to you and speak it into the recorder (which I think is a fantastic idea... especially for people like me who don\'t have the perfect memory). And every single one of them hit the nail on head! It was so cool! I want to go back just for that. They, thankfully, completely shattered all my misconceptions :-).</p>\r\n<p>So I\'m <em>really, really, really</em> excited about what\'s coming up... even if everything seems so mundane now.</p>\r\n','No More Mid-West :-(',0,'','publish','open','open','','no-more-mid-west','','','2007-10-17 23:12:54','2007-10-18 03:12:54','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/?p=85',0,'post','',0),(86,2,'2007-10-18 12:38:47','2007-10-18 16:38:47','<p>Someone tell me how this works&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>I go away for a week on vacation.

This happens for a couple of reasons. One: to see the dog\'s reaction and two: for the small chance that I could actually go galloping away in glee.\r\n\r\nDifferent dogs react differently. Tim\'s old dog, Lucy, who was a mix of greyhound, lab, and shepherd, ran for her life before I could even put any weight on her. Rylie, Alex and Jaclyn\'s Jack Russell, was so small that I would crush it and, well, galloping was just out of the question. And Kodi, my parent\'s husky just kind of immediately sits and looks at me with a cropped head as if to say, \"Do I get my treat now?\"\r\n\r\nWell, tonight I think Kodi proved he had enough when Tim and I were watching a movie. Kodi\'s favorite spot to sit is on top of the sofa and in the middle of the movie Kodi comes off of his usual perch to <em>sit on me</em>. He plops his furry butt on my right shoulder and straddled his legs around my arm with his front paws on my outstretched legs. I thought that he might have been in the process of going from the couch to the floor, but instead he just sat there and stared blankly, hehe.

It’s been like a roller coaster and I’m loving every minute of it (although we’ll see what I say when it’s a ‘down’ moment, hehe).\r\n\r\nI’ve been feeling for awhile that the thing that what God wants me doing right now is simply “doing everything for Him.” So I have no idea what that means.\r\n\r\nLike a week ago I was really, really mad at myself because I had screwed up (again) so I was going to punish myself by watching TV until sunrise. So after I was all TV’ed out and even more upset (and really hungry) I said ‘hell with it’ and decided I was going to go to the kitchen, in the dark, and eat a banana. For God.\r\n\r\nSo with every step on the cold, dark floor towards the kitchen I kept saying to myself, “I’m doing this for You. I will walk excellently for You.” And as I peeled the banana and began to eat it I tried to really absorb the taste and texture. And sometimes I like splitting the banana into three (because it naturally does this, which I think is kinda cool) so I thought about the trinity a bit. And I wasn’t perfect at it at all, in fact I think I scoffed the remaining half of the banana down  because this whole process was very awkward and I just wanted to be done with it :-).\r\n\r\nI felt God just being like “alright, Jess, time for bed” so I went to sleep at the point (I think it was like 6:15 or something). And it wasn’t like I immediately felt the Shekina glory of God, or fell over because I was so moved by the spirit. I still felt awful, my face still sore from crying, I could still taste the tears in my throat, and I could still feel my face cracking from the dried salt deposits, but in some strange way I felt at peace. And I felt loved.\r\n\r\nSo I’ve been trying to do that more. Mainly its small things like eating breakfast or making the bed but it’s weird, even awesome, because now every time I think of my bed or pancakes I think of God. And I think of that experience with God and I almost (not quite, haha) look forward to making the bed in a small way, or especially making pancakes (opposed to something like cereal) because I never make pancakes... but since I kind of first did that with God it’s like a me-and-God-thing. Pancakes, hehe.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh my gosh, I cannot tell you how crazy wonderful my life has been these past couple of days. And even though everything seems to be getting worse (I’m assuming they’re attacks) like Tim and I were up until 1 fighting or my pride has somehow enormously exploded because of all this, it’s wonderful. It’s all wonderful. I feel as though I can find God wherever I want to look for Him.\r\n\r\nAnd since then I can like, <em>feel </em>Him... like, that sense of that ever-present feeling of God has become SO much stronger. I mean like mind-blowing stronger. I can feel Him next to me, and inside of me, all at the same time. And He talks to me. A lot. Like all the time. All I have to do is talk and He talks back. And He’s funny!\r\n\r\nAnd, gosh, I used to worry that this was all me and it was me talking (‘cause it is my voice saying the stuff in my head) but I know it’s like <em>Other</em>. This is absolutely everything I’ve ever wanted and I hope it’s only going to get better... and at the same time I’m terrified that God will remove Himself and I’ll have a Song of Solomon 5 experience and I REALLY don’t want that. And then the pride comes because only really ‘holy’ people have Song of Solomon 5 experiences, and I know that’s not true.\r\n\r\nSo everything is super crazy right now and I don’t know what’s going on.

So due to that, and the fact that I didn\'t really give a general update on Sunday, I\'m stealing his day.\r\n\r\nSunday was Timmy\'s birthday (he\'s 22, but still doesn\'t feel any older) so we celebrated and bought him nice clip-ins pedals and shoes for his bike with a gift certificate from my parents (thanks, mom and dad!).\r\n\r\nOn Saturday we saw Bella, which is definitely a movie worth seeing and supporting. You can see the trailer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPIgx-G4zgU\">here</a>. It reminded me of my passion for adopting an to-be aborted child.. and thus I spent a good two or three days after seeing it fantasizing about meeting people in malls, whilst telling their best friends they\'re going to get \"it\" taken care of, and hero-me, stepping in. Haha. Whatever.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know if \"foggy\" is a valid feeling, but for awhile I\'ve been feeling foggy. Like, stuck almost, like an on-going tiredness that I can\'t seem to shake. I couldn\'t really set my mind to do anything and I felt all-around sluggish, but like more spiritual than physical. Like a mini-curse, haha. So I\'ve been scattered brained. \r\n\r\nAlthough these past two days have been wonderful and God must have lifted the fog off. So I don\'t really know what\'s going on right now. I had a dream awhile ago where Tim and I were in Hawaii and there was this huge wave coming and we were hedged in all around (with actual hedges). And the waves kept pounding us and overtaking us and I\'d fall and stuff, but get back up. I wasn\'t really sure what the dream meant but then I was having an awesome worship time today and I was worshipping with Hosea 6:1-3, which I am so in love with right now. And I just felt like God was saying that He was the raging ocean and He put the hedges up.. like in Psalms 139 where it says \"You hedge me in, behind and before, You lay your hand upon me.\" \r\n\r\nI just love the imagery of God tripping me in order to hold me... except Hosea uses a little more \"hardcore\" imagery and instead of tripping its tearing (ouch) but I still love it. It MUST happen in order that \"we may live before Him.\" And then the immediate verse is, \"Let us know; let us press on to know the Lord!\" Ugh, it\'s just wonderful.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'ve been consumed lately with trying to figure out how to love. I seem do to an absolutely, horrible job every time I try. So, if any of y\'all have any pointers just let me know :-). I thought that maybe my \"fogginess\" could be connected with this anger that I\'ve been struggling with. It\'s like, sometimes in my dreams I get really mad at someone, and I start swinging at them, trying to hit them, and I keep falling asleep as I\'m trying to get a good whack in and I end up tripping over myself and falling into the ground.

That something that costs virtually nothing could be so illuminating. \r\n\r\nSo I\'m taking this as a cue from God to write. I cannot tell you how many times I have had a passion for writing (usually inspired by some good book) and although I might fill the first couple of pages, the passion trickles out of reach and I\'m left with an almost-empty journal, entries weeks apart, ridden with guilt. So maybe because this is God-inspired and not me-inspired (although I certainly have a lot to do with it) I\'ll write as much as I honestly want to.\r\n\r\nSo from now on I want to give abridged updates with a few excerpts from my journal. I know this may sound narcissistic, but when I write something I like, I really, really like it. And of course that may very well lead to pride, but that\'s just something I\'ll have to deal with. I\'ve been learning a new word each day thanks to Shrook and dictionary.com, haha. My favorite word this past week has been \"postprandial\" meaning, after a meal.. like a postprandial nap.\r\n\r\nI was wrong. The feeling didn\'t leave me. Shows you how much I worry about it :-). I think it\'ll always be here. Tim feels really discouraged right now. He says it\'s not me its that he feels like he\'s pulled in a thousand directions (work, school, ministry, his family, my family, our family, etc.) and he feels called to every one of them but can\'t seem to manage all of them.

And so I\'ve kinda been mopping around the house, aimlessly wandering, for the past couple of days simply because I\'m depressed and I don\'t know what else to do.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who aren\'t familiar with the movie it\'s the story of Wilberforce: a man who almost single-handedly ended slavery in Europe. I remember thinking to myself while watching the movie, \"wow, what an exciting time to be alive.\" There was such a clear injustice going on. God created all men equal and here you have men possessing other men because of skin.\r\n\r\nI began to think about what I would be doing if I lived in that time period. Who cares that I would be a woman! I would have rallied up every woman I knew (and maybe earned some respect amongst the men) and held meetings and meetings where we would try and figure out what to do about this lie that has been embedded into our society. I would start saving and saving. And then I would purchase a slave and set them free. And then I would start saving again, living poor. And even if I only could save one slave in my entire life I would feel fulfilled.\r\n\r\nI would allow the issue to consume my life. \r\n\r\nAnd what am I doing about abortion!? What? The issue of abortion isn\'t clear enough for me as slavery is? Is it not a greater and far bigger injustice? I have fifty million dead brothers and sisters and what do I do? I wear a little red bracelet around my right wrist and every time I look at it and I mutter a nice prayer, \"Jesus I plead your blood over my sins and the sin of my nation. Please end abortion and send revival to America,\" and continue with what I was doing.\r\n\r\nDo my brother and sisters not deserve more? Oh, where is my compassion? I can\'t even weep over such a monstrosity! And ugh, I feel powerless to do anything. I could preach someone\'s ear off about their lack of awareness about the subject and I\'m not doing anything about it. And I have such a giant list of excuses: I can\'t offer to adopt someone\'s baby, I\'m living with my parents. I can\'t go to the abortion clinics and befriend someone, that\'s cheap. I can\'t start trying to make people aware, that\'s offensive. Oh, and how the church has cowered in the face of the world because of that word!  \r\n\r\nThis hit me like maybe half way through the movie and at some point in the movie Wilberforce is in immense pain because of this illness that he has and his wife is pregnant. And after tearing apart his bedroom because of the pain, his wife comes up to him and he grabs her protruding stomach and says, (this is totally paraphrased) \"my son! I can hear him now! Tell me about my son!\" As he collapses with pain his wife begins to tell him about his unborn child, \"he will have a voice. He will have a strong voice!\" I can\'t express to you with words what that scene did to me, or how brutal, wonderful and weighty of a scene it was.. I just recommend you seeing it.\r\n\r\nBut the director probably had no idea! There is just a powerful injustice going on and we stuff cotton in our ears because it\'s too big. It\'s just too big. Every woman is encouraged to take birth control, the church especially, and no one is willing to do the research that it can certainly be an abortifacient! And I refuse to tell anyone because I don\'t want to be offensive.

Last year my family procrastinated (we live with parents) and didn\'t buy a tree until the 23rd, so I wanted to make sure no one was running around like headless-chickens a week before Christmas, decorating because that\'s just \"what you do.\" So on Saturday I organized a family-tree-buying outing and we bought a very lovely tree and now its decorated.\r\n\r\nAnd then I realized how utterly boring and \"typical\" the whole thing was and now I\'m kind of sour about it. Sure, it was fun to do with the family, but it wasn\'t any more bonding than a good, hearty dinner conversation.\r\n\r\nAnd then there\'s that expected Christmas pressure to buy gifts. And so the thought processes come: \"But if I don\'t get this person a gift they\'ll get offended at me.\" And the Bible says not to offend, right? Or should I <em>not</em> buy them a gift because it\'s out of a crappy motivation?\r\n\r\nSo this whole thing culminated to a point where Tim and I were trying to make a Christmas list and I muttered (to my demise), \"I wish we just didn\'t do this whole thing.\" And Tim, being awesome, said, \"Well, let\'s not.\" \r\n	\"What? Wait, you mean like not give gifts?\"\r\n	\"Not give gifts, not receive them. We can write letters to your family and tell them we\'re not doing Christmas this year.\"\r\n	I just about spazzed (and I was actually getting upset). \"You can\'t do that! It\'s wrong to refuse blessings from people! That\'s <strong>UNBIBLICAL</strong>! And what if I want to bless people with gifts during Christmas? Huh?! No gifts during Christmas!? Then it wouldn\'t be Christmas!!\"\r\n	I gasped. I actually said that.\r\n	\"Jess, do you realize what you just said?\" I smiled.\r\n\r\n	So after a discussion we decided that next Christmas (if we\'re on our own.. I don\'t think I could handle the drastic social-change while still living with my parents) we are going to start the process of not doing Christmas.\r\n\r\n	And I really don\'t mean to take this lightly. I know this will really upset almost everyone in my family.. from my grandmother who might cry that we\'re abandoning the family to my sister who sees good moral traditions in the traditional Christmas. And I know it\'ll be really hard for me not to go over my our relative\'s houses on Christmas day. If my family still wants to buy us gifts and bless us, that\'s totally fine and wonderful and they can give them to us around the holiday. Don\'t get me wrong, I love buying gifts for people, but I can do that any time of the year. \r\n\r\n     We want to make birthdays really special. On birthdays we will celebrate the person coming into the world. On Christmas we will celebrate Christ coming into the world. It makes so much sense!  Speaking of Christ... \r\n\r\n	Christmas will not be about making Christmas lists and buying for people we feel pressured to buy for and it will not be about trees, and <em>certainly</em> not about Santa. Christmas will be totally centered on Christ. I have no idea the details of all this and we probably won\'t discuss it for some time, and this might prove to be very difficult to do (given how much my family love Christmas... I\'m really not looking forward to that part), but I\'m really excited about it.

And even though I entertain the thought from time to time that I\'m pregnant, I know it\'s not true, and I really am just plain over weight. I didn\'t think I was gaining weight until my family decided to make little comments here and there: \"Jess, you\'re gaining weight,\" \"... when you get health insurance you should go get your cholesterol checked- it\'ll probably be high,\" \"doesn\'t eating that cause you gain more weight?\" \r\n\r\nSo because of all this and the constant eyeing of my tummy I had to ask my family to stop making comments about it because of how upset I was getting.

So reasonably, in fact, that I\'m considering picking them up just to finally get some real research under my belt about the whole weight issue.\r\n\r\nFor years I\'ve had a bone to pick with the whole industry of weight loss because I\'ve always been \"morbidly obese\" according to the BMI (the government\'s standard health indicator based on dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared) and yet, as far as I can tell, relatively healthy in that I can do physical things with ease.  I bike 3 to 4 times a week around 20 miles a day and don\'t really have that hard of a time doing it.  And yet, according to my health classes in school at least, I should just about be on the verge of death and I must loose mass poundage immediately or risk impending destruction via pulmonary rupture and melt-down.  In fact, calculating my current BMI <a href=\"http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/\" title=\"BMI Calculator\">here</a> I have just discovered that in order to reach my healthy weight, I would have to loose over 100 pounds (I currently weigh 280 pounds at 5\'11\" which gives me a BMI of 39.0.  Yeah, that\'s \"morbidly\" obese).\r\n\r\nSo, my question is that with the current emphasis on obesity equaling death and unhappiness, how can I participate in normal activities and even slightly abnormal activities (like biking to work) without too much of a problem.  I would expect that given my morbidly obese status, I should almost be bedridden with a weak heart and atrophied limbs.  But I\'m not.  I lead a fairly normal lifestyle and I feel pretty well.  Ok, all of this is not to say that I wouldn\'t like to feel even healthier.  I\'m definitely not saying that I don\'t have room to grow in this area.  But really, I\'ve always thought that the standard teachings on health in this country just don\'t add up, especially for people like me.\r\n\r\nEnter these two books.

O LORD God, let your word to David my father be now fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can govern this people of yours, which is so great?” God answered Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may govern my people over whom I have made you king, wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like.” So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.\r\n—2Chr. 1:7-9</blockquote>\r\n<strong>Because Solomon’s greatest desire was wisdom, the Lord blessed him in all things.</strong>\r\n\r\nI think what amazes me most about this story is that the God of Genesis 1, Revelation, and Exodus pops in to see Solomon and speaks like a Genie!  This is the “Let there be light!” God; the “Where were you when –, Job?” God.  And yet here he is, asking a man essentially, “What do you wish of me?”.  Wow.  I never thought that through, but it really is incredible.\r\n\r\nI think almost as amazing as the situation itself, though, is Solomon’s response.  Keep in mind that there is very little coercion, if any, going on here.  Solomon=Aladdin and God (at least for the moment) has made himself  =Genie in the Lamp.  Solomon really could ask for anything in the world.  Yet he asks for wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt’s also wonderful how he connects this with the prophetic history of his family.  I get the picture of a very young Solomon in David’s house listening to his Dad pray and sing about the faithfulness of God, being there when David was writing some of the Psalms, just talking with his Dad, and marveling at what God had chosen to do with David.  From that place, Solomon looks out at the huge nation that God had made him king over and says, “If I’m going to be part of that promise, I know one thing that I’m going to need a lot of...”.\r\n\r\n<strong>What I love about this:  It shows that Solomon knew that he was unwise.</strong>\r\n\r\nSolomon got it.  We’ve been going through the Beatitudes at Church recently and of course the very first one is “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”  I’ve been reading some lately and Robb has said a bit about what it means to be poor in spirit.  It’s such a tricky little phrase it seems.  Could’ve said it clearer Jesus? :)  I’ve come to the conclusion, for now, that to be poor in spirit is to realize and possess the knowledge and attitude that in and of yourself, you are completely and utterly incapable of any good.\r\n\r\nI think that is what Solomon did here, and I believe that is why God rewarded him so extravagantly.  He saw a man that truly was poor in spirit, who looked at the task God had so clearly given him, and felt dwarfed and subdued in the face of it.  His one request, when he had every option open, showed where his heart truly was.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts about Solomon or being poor in spirit?

Just read a passage like Exodus 1:7-10 or 2nd Chronicles 1:9 and you’ll get the picture.  They were a powerful, numerous people that more than likely could have relied on their own strength to defend their borders and conquer their enemies.  This is one of the most shocking things that I’ve learned as I’ve read through the histories of the Old Testament.  And yet David gives all of the glory to God over and over again throughout the Psalms, including Psalms 124.</p>\r\n<p>Like Paul, David could have trusted in himself and the power of his nation easily.\r\nI think David shows himself to be a lot like Paul in Phillipians 3:3-7; he had every reason in the flesh to boast.  It actually made sense for him to boast!  Not many people can say that, but he could.  David was the king of one of the most powerful nations in the earth, and yet God gave him the eyes to see that apart from God, the nation would have been swallowed alive.  This is not because they were weak.  It is because in the end the one who decides these things is God. </p>\r\n<p>So David gives glory where glory is due.  No matter how powerful a nation is, they all fall to the hand of God.  Just look at the Assyrians.  Their empire is ruined when God visits judgement upon them for their sins, and they had almost defeated the whole known world by that point.  All man stands at one level before God, and that level is very low.  So, in the end David was also a man who reveals himself to be poor in spirit.</p>\r\n<p>This is something that I so badly want for myself.  I want to understand that no matter what I do in the flesh (some of it good even!), ultimately any good that comes of my life is because of God’s grace towards me.  I mean that literally.  I have no good apart from him!  That’s what I want to believe and experience.

It actually attributes to his genius, but for an impatient reader like myself I had to press on for a bit.\r\n\r\nThank God I did! Once I was past the first little hill, the book flew! I\'ve never had 1200 pages go so fast in my life! Then again, I\'ve never read 1200 pages :-).

So although it was hard to get into a rythym of reading, it was one of the most \"beautiful\" books I\'ve ever read. I would kill to be able to talk like le Comté de Monte Cristo :-) The story-line was just amazing. The movie didn\'t do it an ounce of justice. You could make several exciting movies from that book alone- I can\'t believe they actually attempted at consolidating it!\r\n\r\nAs odd as it sounds sometimes when I picture God I picture the Count. Not in some idolistic way, but all the characteristics that I would picture God having I saw in the Count (even the whole revenge-thing). The Count at one point purchases a Greek child named Haydee who later grows into this beatiful woman and says herself that she loves him like a husband, brother, lover, etc. I thought that the relationship amazingly reminded me of what I\'d like to feel for God.\r\n\r\nSo God definetely helped me find Him in it, which I am extremely happy and blessed with, and thus made the book a total success for me and I would recommend it to anyone.\r\n\r\nMy rating: <strong>* * * * *</strong> (that means 5/5)','The Count of Monte Cristo',0,'','publish','open','open','','the-count-of-monte-cristo','','','2008-04-14 13:22:10','2008-04-14 18:22:10','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/2008/02/19/the-count-of-monte-cristo/',0,'post','',0),(151,2,'2008-02-21 18:07:12','2008-02-21 23:07:12','So, I have recently come up against the brutal realization that I do not have any natural focussing ability.  I am naturally a scatter-brained and dilluted individual.  This really hampers my ability to get anything done.  It’s not that I don’t want to, it’s just that as I go about doing anything my brain is constantly flitting around to other things.  I don’t think this is necessarily all bad.  I appreciate the way God has made me and I believe that it does have some purpose.  But when I need to get something done, I have to have a strategy.  Over a few articles I’m going to attempt to document the strategy that I have taken up in the name of accomplishing the tasks I have set before me.  You’re reading part 1: <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/2007/09/haiku-productivity-the-fine-art-of-limiting-yourself-to-the-essential/\" title=\"Haiku Productivity\">Haiku Productivity</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Haiku Productivity</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat is Haiku Productivity?  It’s first and foremost a fantastic little idea that I read about over on <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/\" title=\"Zen Habits\">Zen Habits</a> (via <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/software/less-is-more/limit-yourself-to-the-essentials-with-haiku-productivity-298581.php?mail2=true\" title=\"Using Haiku Productivity\">Life Hacker</a>).  A Haiku, of course, is a poem that forces extreme brevity upon the author and can produce some of the most charged words possible because, quite literally, every syllable counts.  The basic idea, applied to productivity, is to “intentionally bind ourselves” to doing only a small number of things.\r\n\r\nIf we’re honest with ourselves, we can only focus on a small number of things at a time before our activity degrades to mindlessness.  It’s probably less than you think it is, too.  The strategy, then, is to deliberately reduce the number of things that we are doing at any given time in order to do the things we are doing better and with greater effect.  I’m taking this idea and running with it in the following ways.\r\n\r\n<strong>Divide My Life Into Areas</strong>\r\n\r\nFirst, I have divided my life into rough areas. It’s kind of funny because when I was a bit younger and even now I fiercely opposed compartmentalization. Here I am doing just that. However, I’m not compartmentalizing the <em>important</em> things so much as I am attempting to figure out what exactly it is that is important to me.\r\n\r\nI have divided my life into areas such as God, Friends, Family, Games, Computers, Reading, etc. Within each area I have listed subjects that I want to be focussing on. For instance, in Family I have maintaining relationships as one of my goals. In God I have being discipled and personal prayer. In games I have lists of all of the games I would like to play on each system I have access to that I already have (coincidentally, this has stopped my impulse to buy new games because I have about 100 games that I want to play that I already own!).\r\n\r\n<strong>2 Focus Subjects per Area</strong>\r\n\r\nSecond, I have structured things so that I cannot divide my focus amongst too many subjects within a given area of my life.  The rule is: Focus on no more than 2 subjects in any one area at a time.  This is because I don’t believe I can adequately address anything if I’m focusing on any more than one other subject within that particular area.  What that translates into in the Computer area is that I am only focussing on Web Application Architecture and Design Patterns.  Other areas are the same.\r\n\r\n<strong>2 Areas a Day</strong>\r\n\r\nThird, I allow myself to focus on no more than 2 areas a day.  For instance, on Wednesday my focus is Computers and Reading.  I attempt to focus my free time for that whole day on just those subjects.  The rule from above still applies to this; what that means is that in any given day I am at most focussed on 4 total subjects, with the most at a single time of 2.\r\n\r\n<strong>See Subjects through to completion</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd last, for each area of focus I must complete the subject before I am allowed to move on to the next.  In other words, unless something drastic has come up that forces me to change one of my subjects, I see that subject through to it’s completion.  This forces me to allow a given subject to take as long as it’s going to take.  In the past, I have been plagued with the feeling that I can’t ever complete something because I believe that I should be able to get it done faster than I am.  It always perplexed me when people talked in terms of months and years.  For me, I always expect myself to finish something in a week or two.  No more!  I will let each subject draw out as long as is needed for me to complete it.\r\n\r\nWell, there it is...  That’s how Haiku Productivity looks for me.  It might seem a little complicated, but when you want to do as much as I want to do, I don’t know how else to structure it.\r\n\r\nHave any suggestions?

It was extremely fast paced- I finished it in two days just because of how much action there was. I think I\'d give it 4.5 stars out of 5 because it was very depressing at times, which I think added to the author\'s goal, but depressing nevertheless. It also had some really realistic suggestions for what the future might be like. One of them was a population limit law, which prohibits you from having a third child (which is what Ender is).\r\n\r\nAs far as a brief synopsis goes, all I want to say is that Ender is a really, really smart six year old who is burdened with something that he should have never been burdened with.

I have always struggled mightily with the ability to wake up.  Probably due to my propensity to go to sleep late (because I, for some reason, associate late nights with freedom and adulthood, more on this in some other post), I have always woken up in the morning feeling like a ton of bricks had been repeatedly dropped on my head all night.  I don’t know what a hangover really feels like (having never had an occasion to get one), but if it’s anything like what I wake up feeling like, it must be terrible.\r\n\r\nMonths ago, I decided that I wanted to change this.  I have always wanted to be an early riser, but I never have been able to truly follow through.  I actually believe that God had told me that he wanted me to start waking up early (4:00 AM to be exact).  I said, “Great!” assuming that since it was a command from God, he would magically make me wake up every morning and I’d feel great after a night’s sleep for the first time in my life.  Well, that didn’t happen.  After about a month, I gave up.  I simply refused to consistently make decisions to get me in bed on time, and while I still believe God wanted me to wake up at that time, he will not interfere with our free-will in that manner.\r\n\r\nSo, all of that to say that I’m back at it.  Leo’s article inspired me and I decided to go for it.  The key tip for me was waking up earlier by slowly making incremental steps backward, rather than attempting to make one huge leap backward.  The last time I tried to do this, I literally went from waking up at around 10 and going to sleep around 1 or 2 every night to trying to wake up at 4 and going to sleep at 9 or 10... In One Night!  Obviously, this didn’t work (well, it worked for about a week, until going to sleep at midnight and waking up at 4 took it’s toll).  Some other tips from that article also up for honorable mention are putting the alarm clock far from your bed, leaving the room as soon as you turn the alarm clock off, allow yourself to sleep earlier, and last but no where near the least, Do Not Let Yourself Rationalize!\r\n\r\n<strong>Coupling The Desire To Wake Up Early With A New Lack Of Fear For Routine.</strong>\r\n\r\nNow I’m faced with a decision.  How do I get myself to wake up early and still get things that I want to do done.  After all, I’ve come to the conclusion that I need no small amount of sleep (curse all of you 5 or 6 hours a night people! ;) ); I’ve got to get a solid 7 or 8 hours every night or I start loosing it.  Even at that rate, I still seem to benefit from more sleep in the day.  My current answer?  Routine.  The only way I can see at the moment to guarantee that day after day I’m doing what I want to do is to establish habits in my life that allow me to naturally and effortlessly attain my goals.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who know me, this is a pretty big deal.  I have always been a vocal opponent of habit and routine because I associate it strongly with thoughtless living.  I <strong>hate</strong> thoughtless living.  I don’t like what it does to people.  Thoughtlessness is what allows people to be in this magnificent journey called life and yet be totally unaware in the moment.  Always thinking about the next period of life, never satisfied in the now, never able to appreciate life or situation.  I don’t want to live like that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have decided now that there are two types of habit.  For the sake of simplicity we will refer to them as bad and good habits.  A bad habit is what I would associate with the above.  Generally, they are formed unintentionally by simply doing the same things over and over again.  Also, they have a tendency to be things that we would rather not do but have extreme trouble breaking away from specifically because they are formed naturally by what we do without thinking.  A good habit, to contrast, is a habit that one forms intentionally to help accomplish a goal in there life.  We all have many bad habits; God formed us to be creatures of habit so it’s only natural.  However, I find that many people (myself very much included) do not take this and realize that this same facet that can produce so much entrenched evil in their life can be harnessed purposefully for good.\r\n\r\nThis realization has made me loose my fear of habit.  There are still clear dangers (I’ll discuss the ones I know about later), but I believe that they are outweighed by the benefits.  And, more pointedly, the very practice of forming a habit in your life gives you practice for how to break habits you don’t like.\r\n\r\n<strong>How Am I Actually Implementing This Principle Right Now?</strong>\r\n\r\nBriefly, the main problem I have encountered to date with attempting to create routine in my life is what I term “Variable Days”.  Simple concept: My days do not look the same.  There is a certain amount of built-in, non-voluntary routine (school Tuesdays and Thursdays. Work Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Prayer meeting Monday Night. etc.) however this is very hard to build a routine around simply because of the length of time the cycle takes to repeat itself.  Getting your brain to fall into a routine over the space of a week is <strong>much</strong> harder to do than creating routine over the space of a day that repeats.  So, what I have done is attempt to identify constants over the space of every day that revolve around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation\">behavioral triggers</a>.  These are events that happen every day that I see as useful hook points for a routine execution.  There are three that I’ve identified so far: Waking Up, Getting Home, Going to Sleep.  I’ve started with Waking up and Going to Sleep.<img src=\"http://blog.burningones.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/routineposters.jpg\" alt=\"Routine Poster\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" align=\"right\" />\r\n\r\nI was originally planning on actually telling you all about my routine, but since I suddenly realized that that would qualify easily for TMI and a 10 on the boring scale, I’ve decided to simply describe the structure of the routines.  I actually wrote out my routine in <a href=\"http://neooffice.org/\">NeoOffice Writer</a> and printed a bunch of copies.  The actually format is pictured here (along with the actual routine).  I then posted those all over the house, especially along my routine route.  It was important in the development of the routine that each event naturally flow into the next, i.e. I shouldn’t go to the kitchen, start something there, go back to the room, get something that I could have brought with me in the beginning, and then turn around and go back to the kitchen.  I should leave each area ready for the next.\r\n\r\nThen, when each trigger event happens (Waking up, 8:00 p.m. hitting), I simply glance at the first item on the list and the next and attempt to go through the motions.  As much as possible, I attempt to wean myself from the routine sheet as the brain eventually has to learn how to do this on instinct rather than just because the paper says so.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusion.</strong>\r\n\r\nI’d have to say that the biggest deterrent I have encountered so far is when I mess up and don’t follow my routine.  It’s really easy to get <strong>really</strong> down on yourself when you don’t follow through, especially because so much of your desired activities are wrapped up in your routine.  I don’t know how to get over this at this point, but rest assured I’m being encouraged by my friends and family.  Any encouraging comments would be helpful, as well as any thoughts you have about routine in your own life.  Is it good, is it bad?  Do you have any routines that you wish you could break out of?\r\n\r\nAnyway, can’t wait to hear about it!','To Focus (part 2): Using Routine to Harness the Power of Habit and Get Things Done.',0,'','publish','open','open','','to-focus-part-2-using-routine-to-harness-the-power-of-habit-and-get-things-done','','','2008-04-14 13:12:27','2008-04-14 18:12:27','',0,'http://blog.burningones.com/2008/04/03/to-focus-part-2-using-routine-to-harness-the-power-of-habit-and-get-things-done/',0,'post','',1),(164,2,'2008-04-03 20:00:05','2008-04-04 01:00:05','','Routine Poster',0,'','inherit','open','open','','routine-poster','','','2008-04-03 20:00:05','2008-04-04 01:00:05','',163,'http://blog.burningones.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/routineposters.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(178,1,'2008-04-14 13:15:33','2008-04-14 18:15:33','','Heretics of Dune',0,'','inherit','open','open','','duneheretics-wince','','','2008-04-14 13:15:33','2008-04-14 18:15:33','',157,'http://wordpress.burningones.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/duneheretics-wince.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(166,2,'2008-04-09 06:00:16','2008-04-09 11:00:16','<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-176\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" title=\"theheavenlyman-wince\" src=\"http://wordpress.burningones.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/theheavenlyman-wince.jpg\" alt=\"The True Story of Christian Brother Yun\" width=\"208\" height=\"320\" />What a fantastic book and testimony!  I would challenge anyone who does not believe that God is still moving and speaking today to <a title=\"The Heavenly Man\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heavenly-Man-Remarkable-Chinese-Christian/dp/082546207X\">buy it</a> and read it now!  If this is the work of Satan, I’d appreciate hearing how.\r\n\r\n<strong>Brief Overview.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe book is, as far as I can tell, an autobiography written by Brother Yun, a member of the Sinim Fellowship of House Church Leaders and their official representative to the world, with the help of Paul Hattaway.  Paul leads a coalition of ministries that have a heart to serve the House Church networks of China through partnership and supplies.  There’s very little more to say except to highlight some of the massive works of God in and through Brother Yun.\r\n\r\nYun was saved when he saw his father healed a massive illness that had drove his family into utter poverty.  His mother had met Jesus when she was younger but had lost her faith until that time.  They prayed fervently all night one simple prayer, “Jesus, heal father!”  The following morning, their father was healed.  This started massive revival in their own lives as well as the lives of those around them.  Yun prayed fervently and persistently for three months that God would give him a Bible.  Again, the words were simple, the effect massive!  God answered his prayer, despite the Communist Revolutionary Government having destroyed any Bibles they could find.\r\n\r\nYun has throughout the book was imprisoned 3 times for a total of 7 years for the sake of Jesus.  Truly, hearing his story brings alive what Jesus meant when he said, “Blessed are you when others persecute you and revile you and utter all kinds of evil against you for my name’s sake, for so they treated the prophets of old.  Great is your reward in heaven!”  On one occasion, he fasted absolutely for 74 days under the anointing of the Holy Spirit while in prison as a witness to the Lord.  Many came to Christ through this witness.\r\n\r\nOn the last occasion that he was imprisoned in China (in the book, at least), the Chinese government wanted to teach him a lesson.  So they destroyed his legs by beating them.  He was unable to walk for over 3 months.  One day, the Lord released him from prison and miraculously healed his legs.  There are many witnesses to this event.\r\n\r\nStories such as this abound, but the incredibly refreshing thing is that Brother Yun never tries to focus on them for their own end.  His constant cry as his wife, Deling, reports is this, “We are absolutely nothing.  We have nothing to be proud about.  We have no abilities and nothing to offer God.  The fact that he chooses to use us is only due to his grace.  It has nothing to do with us.  If God should choose to raise up others for his purpose and never use us again we would have nothing to complain about.”  His spirit of humility and grace abounds, though he has experience God’s mighty working.  Oh, that we would have that in America!\r\n\r\n<strong>Take Away Ideas.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe main take away idea that I have is that I am encouraged again to enter into the “simplicity of devotion to Christ.”  What seems most to stand in stark contrast to the American Church in the Chinese House Churches is just that: simplicity.  There aren’t large debates over theological perspectives, but a large and fervent cry to experience God and reach the lost.  Persecution produces this, as does the outpouring of God’s Spirit.  May the Lord have mercy on us and release his power of conviction without producing it through fire!\r\n\r\nAnother idea is that persecution is a necessary part of our faith, and “Woe to you when others speak well of you!”  This is massive in its implications.  Would that the Church in America would not have to pass through judgement in order to experience revival, but the more I read Brother Yun and meditate on the words of Christ, the more I realize that the path to redemption and revival is only on a road with the Cross.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusion.</strong>\r\n\r\nI highly recommend this book.  I will more than likely read it many more times as my life goes on.  May you be encouraged in a similar way and return to the simplicity of devotion.
